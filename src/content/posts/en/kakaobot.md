I have developed a chat bot [1] for Kakaotalk [2] using Go language because I
have been curious about the process of Kakaotalk chat bot development process.
Implementation to major version has consumed only two hours owing to power of
Go language, simpleness of Kakaotalk auto-reply API, and simple simple
functionality requirement of my bot.  It has coded really simply and in
brute-force manner, do only simple echoing.  However, for the reason, the code
could be helpful for beginner of Kakaotalk chat bot or Go language Restful API
server programmer.  That's why I am introducing it here.  You can get the code
from below link:

DAMON talk for OSSummit North America 2024 has been accepted and
[scheduled](https://sched.co/1aBOg).  The talk will present DAMOS auto-tuning
and hopefully, more new DAMO features.  The features are still under
development, but hopefully, the power of presentation-driven development will
make it. ;) Looking forward to meeting you there!

--------------------------------------------------

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/e67a9e90-5a64-b3cc-5014-2fd1e5bf3895@linux.ibm.com

A short mail from Laurent saying he is interested in attending the discussions
about the page fault and `mmap_sem` scalability issue.


Linux 5.6-rc4
-------------

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wgD3=ryAapzdpcZumMK2RQWBvWVE70qp_ft_cjdRX9htQ@mail.gmail.com

Fourthe rc release.  5.6 official release is not so far.  Torvalds says this is
fairly reasonsable sized release.

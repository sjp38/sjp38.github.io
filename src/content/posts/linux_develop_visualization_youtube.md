I created a Youtube channel[1]. I will upload videos for the git history
between each release of the Linux kernel, just for jun. I use gource[2] for the
visualization for now. The scripts I use for these videos are available[3]
under GPL v3. If you want, you may use the scripts for your own video
generation.

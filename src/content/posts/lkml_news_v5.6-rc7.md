Linux 5.6-rc7
-------------

https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAHk-=wipv1y2Z7=CDQ5ajb2OvSyq-0BL9yLRPm1YqW+sjcSDzQ@mail.gmail.com

The world is struggling due to the COVID-19, but kernel development seems quite
normal.  Torvalds released the 7th rc for the Linux 5.6.  There is nothing
strange or worrysome here.  We will get the v5.6 next week, unless something
bad happens.

In the coming second week of December, I will have one and three talks at at
Open Source Summit (OSSummit) Japan and Linux Plumbers (LPC), respectively.

In the Refereed track of LPC, I will
[introduce](https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2075/) new DAMON features
for page level and fleet wide data access monitoring.

In the "Linux System Monitoring and Observability" micro conference of LPC, I
[will](https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2059/) share history and
limitations on DAMON's output visualization formats and discuss how we can
improve.

In the "Device and Specific Purpose Memory" micro conference of LPC, I
[will](https://lpc.events/event/19/contributions/2066/)
discuss a plan for utilizing DAMON for access-aware page migrations on general
NUMA systems including those for CXL, CPU, GPU and any processors.

In OSSummit Japan, I will [introduce](https://sched.co/29FmF) 'hkml', the mail
management tool for Linux kernel development.

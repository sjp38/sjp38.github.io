With the upload of the accepted papers list, EuroSys homepage also updated its
notice about COVID-19 related notification.  It previously tried to reschedule
the offline meeting, however seems they changed mind and decided to do virtual
(online) conference.  It's a bad news for authors and people who planned to
participate the offline meetings, but a good new for other people, because they
would be allowed to participate in the conference without fee.

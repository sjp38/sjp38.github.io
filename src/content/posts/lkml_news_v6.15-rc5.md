Linux 6.15-rc5 (Linus Torvalds)
-------------------------------

https://lore.kernel.org/CAHk-=wgjwfsyPf3SfjrPhAMJqN6brBpajQ3F9qp_TatwOs56YQ@mail.gmail.com

Linus released the fifth candidate for Linux 6.15.  It is larger than the
usual, but still in normal range.  The big size was mainly due to selftest
changes.

Linux 6.15-rc7 (Linus Torvalds)
-------------------------------

https://lore.kernel.org/CAHk-=whtwpdL9e_5j1oq8C=1EZud_cXerZeHqe5L8y7wG+34EA@mail.gmail.com

Linus Torvalds released the seventh candidate version for Linux 6.15.  Linus
mentions last week was having some exciting events including CPU bug
mitigations, Xe fixes and sched_ext fixes.  Which is not what Linus wanted.
But still he beleives those were reasonable and solid in whole.  Still he aims
to release 6.15 next week, unless something strange happens.

      <title>RCX: Read-Copy Transact</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Read-copy update (RCU) can provide ideal scalability for read-mostly workloads,
but some believe that it provides only poor performance for updates. This
belief is due to the lack of RCU-centric update synchronization mechanisms. RCU
instead works with a range of update-side mechanisms, such as locking. In fact,
many developers embrace simplicity by using global locking. Logging, hardware
transactional memory, or fine-grained locking can provide better scalability,
but each of these approaches has limitations, such as imposing overhead on
readers or poor scalability on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems, mainly
due to their lack of NUMA-aware design principles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This project introduces an RCU extension (RCX) that provides highly scalable
RCU updates on NUMA systems while retaining RCUâ€™s read-side benefits. RCX
combines hardware transactional memory (HTM) and traditional locking based on
our NUMA-aware design principles for RCU. Micro-benchmarks on a NUMA system
having 144 hardware threads show RCX has up to 22.61 times better performance
and up to 145.00 times lower HTM abort rates compared to a state-of-the-art
RCU/HTM combination. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of RCX,
we have applied RCX to parallelize some of the Linux kernel memory management
system and an in-memory database system. The optimized kernel and the database
show up to 24 and 17 times better performance compared to the original version,
respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

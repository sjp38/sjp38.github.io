      <description>As today is the first day of 2026, I checked my open source commits statistics using my simple and buggy scripts. Similar statistics for 2024 is available at another post.
Note that the script may have bugs, and numbers don&amp;rsquo;t tell everything.
TL; DR In short, I made 2nd and 1st biggest changes to Linux kernel memory management subsystem among the 321 people, in terms of lines of changes (6,661 / 73,685 lines) and commits (199 / 1,870 commits).</description>

      <description>In the coming second week of December, I will have one and three talks at at Open Source Summit (OSSummit) Japan and Linux Plumbers (LPC), respectively.
In the Refereed track of LPC, I will introduce new DAMON features for page level and fleet wide data access monitoring.
In the &amp;ldquo;Linux System Monitoring and Observability&amp;rdquo; micro conference of LPC, I will share history and limitations on DAMON&amp;rsquo;s output visualization formats and discuss how we can improve.</description>

      <title>UTM-based Linux kernel development environment on Macbook Pro</title>

      <description>I got a Macbook Pro. I was wondering if I can do kernel development on it since I recently learned that modern small computers are fast enough to be used for frequent kernel builds. I also heard a few of my previous colleague kernel developers use their Macbook for kernel builds.
Unfortunately I cannot install Linux kernel on the laptop at the moment, though. I hence created a Debian13 VM on it using UTM and ran the kernel compile benchmark.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I heard modern normal computers can build kernel faster than I expected. My 10 years old personal laptop (Thinkpad X1) used to build a kernel per a couple of hours. The last time I built kernel on the laptop was about 8 years ago. Since then, I was always using only workstation or server level machines for building kernels.
So I wanted to know how good modern normal desktop-level machines are, by myself.</description>

      <description>I started subscribing linux kernel mailing list with my gmail account in 2013. Dealing with the large amount of mails was not that easy, probably due to my poor setup and being lazy at trying more tools.
In 2019, while returning from Linux Plumbers Conference, I read an LWN article saying Linus Torvalds is now considering unsubscribing the linux kernel mailing list, owing to the evolvement of the public-inbox and lore.</description>

      <description>DAMON talk for OSSummit EU 2023 has accepted and scheduled. The talk will focus on its user-space tool, damo. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly for helping more audiences to digest the content easier, and also for accelerating the development of damo. By the time, hopefully the version of damo would reach to, or exceed 2.0.0, and newer interface and features will be introduced together.
The title of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Data Access Monitoring Operator (DAMO): User-Space Tool/Python Library for Access-Aware Profiling and Optimization of Your Linux Systems&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>2022년 마지막 날을 맞아, 저의 간단하고 버그가 많은 스크립트와[1] github 을 통해 저의 오픈소스 커밋 통계를 내봤습니다.
리눅스 커널 통계 리눅스 커널의 메모리 관리 서브시스템과 커널 전체의 2022년 통계를 위해 제 버그 많은 스크립트를[1] 아래와 같이 돌려 봤습니다.
메모리 관리 서브시스템 2022년 한해, 305명의 사람들이 리눅스 커널 메모리 관리 서브시스템 개발에 참여해 81,631 라인의 변경을 2,135 개 커밋으로 만들었습니다.
변경한 라인 수와 커밋 갯수 기준으로 저는 그 305명 가운데 두번째와 (10,537 라인) 세번째로 (106 커밋) 큰 변경을 만들었군요.</description>

      <description>Whenever reading the kernel development statistics report for each release from LWN, I wanted to scope it down to specific subsystems. For that, I wrote a script.
Belows are the top 10 kernel hackers who contributed to the memory management subsystem of Linux kernel, sorted by number of commits and changed (added, deleted, or modified) lines, respectively.
$ ./authors.py ~/linux --file mm/ --since 2021-01-01 --author_identity name --sortby lines --max_nr_authors 10 1.</description>

DMon: Efficient Detection and Correction of Data Locality Problems Using Selective Profiling https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi21-khan.pdf
DMon is a compiler-based data locality optimization system. The approach is quite similar to that of daphicx or similar things. It injects data access profiling code in the target program, build and run it with some workload, collect the profiling code-generated results, analyze the profile results to figure out what kind of optimization can provide some benefit to the program, injects the optimization code in the program, built it again, and deploy the version to the production.</description>

트위터의 in-memory 캐시 시스템의 워크로드를 트레이스하고 그 특성을 분석한 논문입니다. 개인적으로 아래 내용이 흥미로웠습니다.
쓰기 리퀘스트가 많음. 각 오브젝트의 크기는 작아서 (중간값이 200 바이트), 오브젝트별 메타데이터 (64 바이트) 가 공간을 많이 차지함. 키의 크기가 밸류의 크기보다 그렇게 작지 않음. 트레이스 데이터는 github[1] 통해 받을 수 있습니다.</description>

The authors traced and analyzed the workloads on the Twitter&amp;rsquo;s in-memory cache systems. To me, below findings were interesting.
There are many write requests. Size of each object is not so big (median 200 bytes), so metadata, which sizes 64 bytes per each object, is a burden Size of each key is not small compared to the size of each value.</description>

      <description>올해 초, 우연히 전자잉크 태블릿인 Remarkable 2 의 소개 영상 을 보게 되었습니다. 간단하지만 분명한 목표 (&amp;lsquo;종이&amp;rsquo;와 같은 사용경험) 에 집중한 디자인과 기능이 무척 매력적으로 다가왔습니다. 망설이다 7월에 한번 더 사이트에 들어가 봤는데, 선주문 기간인데다 팬데믹 등의 영향으로 11월에야 배송된다고 하더군요. 한달 내로는 무료 반품도 된다길래 고민할 시간은 많으니 일단 지르고 고민해 보자는 생각으로 질렀습니다.
한참의 시간이 지나, 지난 월요일에 마침내 제품을 받게 되었습니다. 개인적으로 처음 구매해 본 전자잉크 기기인데, 이제 겨우 일주일 됐지만 제법 만족스럽게 사용 중입니다.</description>

      <description>다양한 형태로 생각을 기록하고 가끔은 공유도 해왔습니다. 그 생각들을 오래도록 안전히 보관하고 싶었지만 몇차례 시행착오를 거치며 그게 쉽지 않음을 깨달았습니다.
시작은 일기장과 노트였습니다. 분실하기도 쉽고 구석에 쳐박아 두면 다시 볼일도 거의 없더군요.
클라우드 문서 서비스가 매력적이어 보였습니다. 하지만 영원한 건 없고 결국 그때 그때 흥하는, 또는 사용 가능한 서비스를 옮겨다녀야 하더군요. 그러다보니 서비스마다의 호환성이 문제가 됩니다.

      <description>최근, Sphynx 빌드 시스템[1] 을 사용해 html 로 빌드한 리눅스 커널 문서를 Github page[2] 에 올리려 했습니다. DAMON[3] 문서를 어디서나 볼 수 있게 하려 함이었는데요. 업로드는 쉬웠습니다. 리포지토리 만들고, Sphynx 로 빌드된 Documentation/output/ 의 문서를 여기에 집어넣고 푸시했죠. 하지만, 테마가 적용되지 않아 보기 안좋더군요.
Github 은 모든 Github page 들이 Jekyll[4] 에 기반하고 있다고 생각하며, Jekyll 에서는 _ 로 시작하는 이름의 모든 파일과 디렉토리가 특수하게 처리되기 때문에, Sphynx 에서 생성한 일부 디렉토리가 무시되고 있었습니다.</description>

      <description>I recently tried to upload the Linux kernel document which is generated in html form using the Sphynx build system[1] on a Github page[2] so that people can read DAMON[3] document from everywhere. The upload was very easy. I simply created the repo, put the generated html doc at Documentation/output/ into the repo and pushed. However, the theme was not applied.
Github assumes every Github pages to be based on Jekyll[4], and because every files and directories starting with underscores are handled special in Jekyll, some directories Sphynx created were ignored.</description>

It previously tried to reschedule the offline meeting, however seems they changed mind and decided to do virtual (online) conference. It&amp;rsquo;s a bad news for authors and people who planned to participate the offline meetings, but a good new for other people, because they would be allowed to participate in the conference without fee.</description>

      <description>Read-copy update (RCU) can provide ideal scalability for read-mostly workloads, but some believe that it provides only poor performance for updates. This belief is due to the lack of RCU-centric update synchronization mechanisms. RCU instead works with a range of update-side mechanisms, such as locking. In fact, many developers embrace simplicity by using global locking. Logging, hardware transactional memory, or fine-grained locking can provide better scalability, but each of these approaches has limitations, such as imposing overhead on readers or poor scalability on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems, mainly due to their lack of NUMA-aware design principles.</description>

Logging, hardware transactional memory, or fine-grained locking can provide better scalability, but each of these approaches has limitations, such as imposing overhead on readers or poor scalability on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems, mainly due to their lack of NUMA-aware design principles.</description>

      <description>In some case, we need to send patches that made by other people instead. git send-email command can know this situation by itself by comparing the commit author information and mail sender&amp;rsquo;s information. In that case, git send-email automatically add From: line pointing the real author of the patch in the body of the mail so that maintainers applying the patches can set the author information correctly.
For example, if &amp;ldquo;Alice alice@abc.</description>

      <description>많은 개발 커뮤니티가 요즘은 Github 을 사용합니다만, 일부 커뮤니티는 여전히 메일링 리스트 기반 개발 스타일을 고수하고 있습니다. 리눅스 커널 커뮤니티가 좋은 예가 되겠죠. 이런 스타일에서는 모든 주요 커뮤니케이션이 이메일을 통해 이루어집니다. 패치는 메인테이너와 하나 이상의 공개 메일링 리스트를 향해 메일의 형태로 보내어집니다. 리뷰 또한 이에 대한 답장의 형태로 이루어지지요.
그런데, 일부 이메일 클라이언트는 ``rich user experience&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; 라는 명목하에 원래 내용을 오염시키곤 합니다. 탭을 스페이스로 바꾸거나 html 코드를 집어넣거나 하는 식이죠. 때문에 패치를 보내는 사람은 자신의 메일 내용이 원래 의도한대로 읽는 사람에게 보내지도록 조심해야합니다.</description>

      <description>Many communities are using Github nowadays, but some communities still use mailing list based development style. The Linux kernel community would be a good example. In the style, all major communications are made by email only. Patches are submitted to the maintainers and one more open mailing lists as a mail. Reviews are also made as replies to the mail.
Because some email clients can distort the original content for so-called ``rich user experience&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo; (e.</description>

      <description>Memory pressure is inevitable as the size of working sets is rapidly growing while the capacity of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) is not. Meanwhile, storage devices have evolved so that their speed is comparable to the speed of DRAM while their capacity scales are comparable to that of hard disk drives (HDD). Thus, hierarchial memory systems configuring DRAM as the main memory and high-end storages as swap devices will be common.</description>

      <description>LD_PRELOAD 환경변수를 사용하면 로더가 프로그램을 로드할 때 동적 로드해야 할 바이너리 코드를 해당 변수의 값의 디렉토리에서부터 뒤지도록 합니다. 따라서 이를 이용해 malloc(), free() 등의 일반적으로 사용하는 라이브러리 함수를 우리의 구현으로 대체하거나 후킹할 수 있습니다. 이 글은 이런 방법으로 malloc() 을 후킹하는 방법을 예제를 통해 간단히 설명합니다.
Original Program 먼저 다음과 같은 프로그램이 있을 수 있을 겁니다:
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt; #include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt; int main(void) { char *abc; abc = (char *)malloc(8); printf(&amp;#34;malloced address: %p\n&amp;#34;, abc); sprintf(abc, &amp;#34;hello\n&amp;#34;); printf(&amp;#34;%s\n&amp;#34;, abc); free(abc); return 0; } 단순히 malloc() 을 통해 8바이트 메모리를 할당받아 그 영역을 표시하고 종료하는 프로그램입니다.</description>

      <description>디버깅 과정에선 현재 어떤 코드가 어떤 함수를 거쳐 수행됐는지를 통한 컨텍스트 파악이 중요합니다. Java, Python, Go 등 대부분의 언어가 이를 위해 콜스택을 뽑을 수 있는 기능을 제공하죠. C 언어의 경우 gdb 등을 사용하면 쉽게 이를 볼 수 있지만 경우에 따라선 gdb 를 포기하고 printf() 등에만 의존해야 하기도 합니다. 이를 위한 기능이 c 라이브러리에도 있습니다, backtrace() 함수입니다. man 에도 이에 대한 설명이 있습니다만, 여기서도 간단히 소개해 봅니다.

      <description>업데이트 (2020-01-01): KUnit 은 v5.5 머지 윈도우 사이 메인라인에 머지되었습니다. 이 포스트 작성 시점 이후로 많은 KUnit 에도 많은 변화가 있었고, 따라서 아래 내용 중 일부, 특히 테스트 셋업과 수행 부분은 좀 많이 달라졌습니다. 해당 내용을 위해선 공식 문서 를 참고하시길 권장합니다. 또한, 최신 버전은 파이썬 버전 종속성이 생겨서 우분투 16.04 위에서는 문제를 겪으실 수 있습니다. 최신버전의 파이썬을 쓰시거나 그냥 우분투 18.04 를 사용하시길 권장합니다.

      <description>Update (2020-01-01): KUnit has merged in v5.5 merge window. From the writing of this post, it had some changes, so below content, especially the test setup and running will not work. Recommend you to refer to the official document in the kernel for detailed tutorial. It also has a python version dependency now, so you would encounter a problem with Ubuntu 16.04. Recommend you to use later Python or Ubuntu 18.</description>

      <description>연구실 내부 사용을 위한 Gitlab 을 Docker 를 사용해서 구축하고 사용하고 있습니다만, 하도 예전이라 Gitlab official docker image 가 아니었고, docker 버전도 2.x 대라서 최신 버전으로 바로 업그레이드가 불가능하군요.
지금은 gitlab 에서 자체적으로 정식 docker 이미지를 제공합니다. 이 포스트에서는 Ubuntu 18.04 서버 위에 gitlab 정식 docker 이미지를 사용해 설치하는 방법을 기록합니다.
Docker 설치 먼저 Docker 를 설치해야죠. 문서[1]를 참고해서 설치를 진행해 봅니다.
먼저 apt 업데이트 후 종속 패키지들을 깔아줍니다:
sudo apt update sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common 이제 최신 docker 를 깔기 위해 docker repository 를 apt 에 추가해 주고요:</description>

기본적으로 저는 글을 읽는걸 좋아하기도 하고 읽어야만 하기도 합니다. 그러다보니 여행을 가더라도 항상 어떤 책을 들고갈까 고르는게 설레기도 하지만 짜증나기도 하고, 마음만 앞서서 캐리어 무게를 책으로 꽉 채우기도 합니다. 그래서 예전부터 이북을 고려해 봤지만 너무 반응속도가 느리기도 하고 인쇄된 것에 비해선 가독성도 떨어지고 그 특유의 책을 넘겨가며 보는 반응은 아닌 것 같아 구매하지 않고 있었습니다.</description>

수년간 리눅스 커널 개발자들이 사용해온 다양한 리비전 컨트롤 방법, Linus Torvalds가 Bit keeper 를 사용하기로 한 결정과 그에 뒤따른 논쟁, 그리고 어떻게 Git 이 만들어졌는가에 대한 글입니다.
처음에, Linus Torvalds는 리비전 컨트롤을 아예 사용하지 않았습니다. 커널에 코드를 기여하고자 하는 사람은 Usenet 그룹에, 나중에는 메일링 리스트에 패치를 올렸고, Linus는 자신의 소스 트리에 그걸 적용했습니다.</description>

      <description>라즈베리 파이를 메인 컴퓨터로 사용하려는게 아니라면, 라즈베리 파이에 모니터와 키보드, 마우스를 연결하고 사용하는게 아무래도 번거롭습니다. ssh 로 붙어서 작업하는 것도 한 방법이지만, 그게 여의치 않은 상황도 있습니다. 그저 터미널만 연결되면 되는 상황이라면, 가장 간단한 건 UART Serial 통신을 사용하는 겁니다.
라즈베리 파이는 UART 통신을 지원하고 있는데, GPIO 핀 중 14번과 15번이[2] 각각 TX, RX 입니다. 호스트 컴퓨터와 이 두개의 핀을 연결하면 UART 통신을 할 수 있어서 라즈베리 파이의 터미널에 바로 접근할 수 있습니다.</description>

라즈베리 파이는 SD 카드를 저장소로 사용합니다. 따라서 여기에 운영체제를 깔아야 합니다. 다만, 라즈베리 파이를 구매하면 SD 카드는 따라오지 않습니다. 각자 알아서 사야 합니다. 전 예전에 사둔 16 GiB 짜리 SD 카드를 사용하겠습니다.
라즈베리 파이를 지원하는 운영체제는 여러가지 있는데, 데비안 계열의 Raspbian 이 공식 운영체제입니다. 다운로드 페이지 에서 Raspbian stretch lite 를 다운받고 압축을 풀어줍니다.

      <description>리눅스 커널 커뮤니티는 버그 레포팅, 패치 업로드, 리뷰, 릴리즈, 토론 등등 모든 활동은 이메일을 통해 이루어집니다. 이 포스트에서는 리누스 토발즈도 쓰는 이메일 클라이언트인 Alpine 을 gmail 과 연동하는 방법을 알아봅니다.
먼저 alpine 설치는 대부분 리눅스 배포판의 패키지 시스템에 등록되어 있으므로 해당 패키지 시스템을 사용해 쉽게 설치할 수 있습니다. 데비안 계열이면 apt install alpine, 페도라 계열이면 dnf install alpine 이죠.

      <description>You can use classical debugger for your Linux kernel programming, though Torvalds doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it. I also do not prefer such use of debuggers, but admit that sometimes debuggers are quite useful. ;)
There are several ways to debug Linux kernel, but one of above is to set up a Linux virtual machine using QEMU and debugging the Linux kernel of the virtual machine from the host machine. This post summarises how to debug the Linux kernel in this way.</description>

      <description>토발즈는 좋아하지 않지만, 리눅스 커널 프로그래밍에도 디버거를 사용할 수 있습니다. 저도 디버거 사용을 좋아하지는 않는 편이지만, 경우에 따라선 디버거를 사용하는게 좋을 때도 있고 취향은 존중되어야죠. ;)
커널 디버깅 방법은 여러가지가 있는데, 그 중 하나는 QEMU 등을 이용한 리눅스 가상 머신을 띄워 두고, 호스트 머신에서 해당 가상 머신의 리눅스 커널을 디버깅 하는 방법입니다. 이 글에선 이렇게 디버깅 하는 방법을 간단히 정리해 봅니다.
테스트 환경 글 작성 과정에서 테스트에 사용한 주요 소프트웨어들과 버전은 다음과 같습니다.</description>

      <description>경우에 따라서 SPEC CPU2006 의 벤치마크 중 일부의 소스코드를 수정하고 싶을 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 특정 벤치마크가 구체적으로 어떻게 동작하는지 알아보기 위해 디버깅 메세지를 추가하고자 할수도 있고, 코드 변경을 통해 성능을 높인다거나 해볼 수도 있겠죠. 그러나, SPEC CPU2006 은 엄정한 벤치마크 수트이기 때문에 소스코드는 물론, 소스코드를 사용하는 도구가 변경된 경우 에러 메세지를 내고 수행을 거부합니다. 수정된 소스코드로 얻어진 결과는 벤치마크 결과로 적합하지 않기 때문이죠.
때문에, 어쩔 수 없이 수정이 필요하면서도 기존의 수행 방법을 따르려면 이 에러를 내는 곳을 없애는 게 한가지 방법이 될 수 있습니다.</description>

      <description>컨퍼런스 둘째날부터는 kernel summit track 이 시작됩니다. 이번 컨퍼런스 참가는 아무래도 kernel summit 에서의 시끄럽고 정신없는 토론에 참여하고 싶기 때문이었기에 오늘부터가 제게는 가장 재밌는 시간입니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_05/1.jpg)
아침 일찍 일어나 컨퍼런스 장소로 출발합니다. 10명이 함께 묵는 방을 사용하고 있기에 일찍 일어나지 않으면 샤워를 제시간에 하기 어려우므로 조금 일찍 일어났습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_05/2.jpg)
![foo] (/img/osse_05/3.jpg)
![foo] (/img/osse_05/4.jpg)
일찍 출발한 만큼 일찍 도착. 아직 부스에 사람도 없고 조용하네요. 한동안 부스 한켠에 준비된 휴식 공간에 앉아 커널 메일링 리스트도 읽고 코드도 보고 했습니다.</description>

      <description>드디어 컨퍼런스 첫날입니다. 아침 8시부터 아침식사와 등록이 시작되므로, 7시에 숙소에서 나왔습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_04/1.jpg)
어제는 날이 흐리더니, 오늘은 비도 옵니다. 우산을 챙겨 나옵니다. 그래도 어제 미리 학회장에 들렀던 덕에 길을 헤매지 않고 찾아갈 수 있었습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_04/2.jpg)
빗길을 따라 한참을 걸어서 도착했습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_04/3.jpg)
![foo] (/img/osse_04/4.jpg)
도착하니 7시 반 정도. 공식 스케쥴은 8시부터 시작이라 아직 한산합니다. 스폰서 부스도 아직 준비중인 곳이 많고, 아직 준비가 덜된 곳도 많습니다. 돌아다니며 인사도 하고 간단한 스몰토크도 하면서 시간을 보냈습니다.</description>

      <description>OSSummit 등록도 마쳤고, 남은 하루는 프라하 성 쪽을 둘러보기로 했습니다. 내일부터는 OSSummit 발표를 아침부터 오후까지 들어야 하므로, 프라하 관광을 해가 떠있을 때 하는건 오늘이 마지막이니 부지런히 걸어야 합니다. 어떻게 생각해 보면 꽤 강행군이기도 하고, 아침 일찍 도착하길 다행이다 싶습니다.

OSSummit 컨퍼런스 회장인 힐튼 프라하 호텔은 프라하 시내의 동북쪽에 위치해 있어서 조금만 걸으면 아침에 심카드 사고 나서 걸었던 블타바 강이 나옵니다. 아까 지나갔던 코스지만 한번 더 걸어가기로 합니다.</description>

먼저 공항에서 입국심사를 거쳐야 합니다. 한글 표지판이 많이 있어서 영어에 익숙지 않은 분들도 비교적 쉽게 적응할 수 있겠다 싶었습니다.
제가 가장 많이 다녀온 외국은 미국인데요. 대한민국 여권 소지자는 미국에 갈 때 비자가 필요없지만 E-SATA 로 등록을 해야 하고, 언젠가부터 E-SATA 등록비도 몇만원 정도 생겼죠. 또, 미국은 입국심사가 왠지 날카롭다는 인상입니다. 입국할 때 입국심사 카드도 써야하고 여기 숙소 주소 등도 적어야 하고, 지문도 찍어야 하죠. 공항 보안검색대에선 투시카메라로 사진도 찍고.</description>

Open Source Summit Europe 과 Embedded Linux Conference Europe, 그리고 Annual Kernel Summit 이 합동으로 열린 프라하에 다녀왔습니다. 이에 대한 기록을 남겨봅니다.
The Event 리눅스 재단에서는 다양한 컨퍼런스를 개최합니다. 2015년까지는 한국에서도 Korea Linux Forum 이라는 행사를 매년 열었죠. 특히 2015년에는 커널 서밋도 함께해서 특히 특별했던 기억입니다. 이런 이벤트들 중에서도 가장 큰 이벤트는 오픈소스 서밋이 아닐까 싶습니다. 이 이벤트는 기존의 리눅스콘 등 행사들이 합쳐진 행사입니다. 가장 큰 이벤트가 오픈소스 서밋이라면 가장 중요한 행사는 커널 서밋이라 할 수 있지 않을까 싶습니다.</description>

      <description>Database 를 위해 사용되는 벤치마크는 크게 OLTP vs OLAP 로 나뉩니다[1]. OLTP 계열의 대표주자는 TPC-C 이고, OLAP 계열의 대표주자 중 하나로 TPC-H[2] 가 있습니다. 이 글에서는 TPC-H 를 MariaDB 에서 돌리는 방법에 대해 설명합니다.
Environment Setup 이 글을 작성하면서 사용한 운영체제와 소프트웨어들의 버전은 다음과 같습니다.
Ubuntu 16.04.2 Server MariaDB 10.2.8 TPC-H toolkit 2.17.2 Automated Scripts 아래 설명할 모든 내용을 자동화 해서 손쉽게 TPC-H 를 돌릴 수 있도록 소스코드 변경부터 빌드, 수행까지 정리한 스크립트들을 github 에 올려 두었습니다: https://github.</description>

      <description>현재 사용중인 랩탑에 설치한 OS 는 Fedora 24 였는데, 너무 오래되었고 지원도 얼마전 끝났기에[0] 이번에 Fedora 26 으로 새로 설치했습니다. 마침 go 언어도 1.9 가 최근에 릴리즈 되었기에 개인적으로 go 언어를 설치하는 방법을 기록해 둡니다.
여기선 소스 코드만 가지고 빌드, 설치하는 방법을 기록합니다.
Get Source Code go 언어는 오픈소스입니다. 다음 커맨드를 통해 구글로부터 소스코드를 받아올 수 있습니다.
$ git clone https://go.googlesource.com/go 기다리면 go/ 디렉토리에 소스코드가 딸려옵니다.
golang 1.4 Build &amp;amp; Install go 언어를 빌드한다는 건 go 언어 컴파일러와 기본 라이브러리 등과 같은, go 언어로 짠 프로그램을 빌드하고 수행하는데 필요한 도구들을 빌드한다는 이야기입니다.</description>

      <description>I wrote a simple, stupid program[1] that showing LKML[2] mails in terminal briefly like twitter livestream in Go language. It is just an early version and so many things to be complemented exists, though. Nevertheless, now it just works as I wanted at first.

      <description>I am using Fedora 23 laptop and installed stable version Google Chrome from its official website [0]. In this case, just using Updates of Fedora Software program doesn&amp;rsquo;t update Chrome automatically. For the case, follow below commands to update your Chrome:
$ sudo dnf update google-chrome-stable ... $ sudo killall chrome $ google-chrome-stable The second killall command is necessary because Chrome doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill its process by just cliking Close button. Or, you may reboot your computer but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like that.</description>

      <description>랩톱에 Fedora 23 을 깔고 크롬을 공식 홈페이지 [0] 에서 다운받아 메인 브라우저로 사용하고 있습니다. 그런데 이렇게 설치한 경우에는 단순히 Fedora Software 프로그램의 Updates 기능을 통해 업데이트가 되지 않더군요. 이런 경우에는 다음의 커맨드를 통해 직접 업데이트를 할 수 있습니다:
$ sudo dnf update google-chrome-stable ... $ sudo killall chrome $ google-chrome-stable 두번째의 killall 커맨드는 Chrome 프로세스들이 닫기 버튼을 누르는 것만으로는 모두 종료되지 않기 때문에 명시적으로 종료시키기 위해 필요합니다. 컴퓨터를 아예 리붓 하는 방법도 있겠지만 별로 그러고 싶지는 않을테지요.</description>

      <description>I have developed a chat bot [1] for Kakaotalk [2] using Go language because I have been curious about the process of Kakaotalk chat bot development process. Implementation to major version has consumed only two hours owing to power of Go language, simpleness of Kakaotalk auto-reply API, and simple simple functionality requirement of my bot. It has coded really simply and in brute-force manner, do only simple echoing. However, for the reason, the code could be helpful for beginner of Kakaotalk chat bot or Go language Restful API server programmer.</description>

      <description>Kakaotalk [1] chat bot [2] 은 어떻게 만드는지 궁금해져서 Go 언어로 간단한 Kakaotalk chat bot 을 만들어 봤습니다. Go 언어의 강력함과 Kakaotalk auto-reply API 의 단순성, 그리고 echo 서버 역할 정도만 하자는 심플하다 못해 썰렁한 기능 목표 덕에 최초 목표한 데까지는 두시간 만에 만들어졌습니다. 매우 단순히 echo 서버 정도의 역할만 하고 있지만, 매우 단순하게 짜여져 있기 때문에 Kakaotalk chat bot 을 만들고자 할 때, 또는 Restful API 를 사용하는 서버를 Go 언어로 짜고자 할 때 시작용으로 참고할 만 하지 않을까 싶어 소개합니다.</description>

      <title>Using arping to know ip-MAC mapping</title>

      <guid>https://sjp38.github.io/posts/arping-howto/</guid>
      <description>You can use arping to know IP address to MAC address mapping of your local network. Usage is simple:
arping [-AbDfhqUV] [-c count] [-w deadline] [-s source] -I interface destination For example, you may use the command as below:
$ arping -I eth0 10.0.0.1 ARPING 10.0.0.1 from 10.0.0.2 eth0 Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.123ms Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.251ms ... Secret of the tool is ARP protocol [1]. To know the MAC address of the machine that has a specific IP address, IP protocol layer uses the protocol.</description>

      <description>로컬 네트워크에서 어떤 IP 주소가 어떤 MAC 어드레스에 매핑되는지 알기 위해 arping 을 사용할 수 있습니다. 사용법은 간단합니다:
arping [-AbDfhqUV] [-c count] [-w deadline] [-s source] -I interface destination 예를 들면, 다음과 같습니다:
$ arping -I eth0 10.0.0.1 ARPING 10.0.0.1 from 10.0.0.2 eth0 Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.123ms Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.251ms ... 이 툴의 동작 원리는 ARP 프로토콜 [1] 입니다. IP 프로토콜 레이어는 이 프로토콜을 사용해 특정 IP 주소를 사용하는 기계의 MAC 어드레스를 파악하고 이 주소를 아랫단의 Ethernet 레이어에 보냅니다.</description>

      <description>꽤 맘에 드는 hugo 테마[1]를 찾았다. 하지만 tag 기능이 빠져있어 너무 아쉬워하다가 이대로 포기하기엔 너무 맘에 들어 이래저래 찾아보니 과거에 tag 기능 관련 이슈가 올라왔지만 close 처리된 상태. 이대로는 암만 기다려도 tag 기능을 구현해주진 않겠구나 싶어서 이것저것 보고 낑낑대며 서툴고 간단하게나마 tag 기능을 구현[2]. Pull request[3] 도 보냈는데 과연 받아들여줄런지.
업데이트: 별다른 discussion 없이 머지됐다 ;)

      <description>이사로 생긴 쓰레기 정리를 돕다가 보니 한 물건이 유난히 눈에 띄었다. 자그마한 크기에 왠지 모르게 90년대 감성. 자세히 살펴 보니 전자사전 같이 생겼는데 왠지 옛날에 유행하던 palmtop[1] 같은 느낌. 어차피 버릴 물건이기에 따로 챙겨두고 컴퓨터로 검색을 해보았다.
![HP 95LX] (/img/hp95lx/1.jpg)
모델명인 HP 95LX 로 검색해보니[2] 한때 스프레드시트 프로그램의 대명사였던 Lotus 123 을 탑재한 것으로 유명한 palmtop PC 로, MS-DOS 를 장착한 모델이다. 당연하게도 바로는 안켜지지만 잘 살펴보니 전용 배터리가 아니라 2A 건전지를 사용하고 있기에 건전지를 끼고 파워 버튼을 눌러봤지만 역시 잠잠.</description>

      <description>테스트 등을 위해 소스코드로부터 커널을 직접 빌드, 설치하기 시작하면 어느새 수많은 커널이 설치되어 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다. 삭제를 위해선 make install 로 만들어진 파일들을 직접 제거하고 grub 을 업데이트 해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 시스템이 현재 부팅되어 있는 버전의 커널을 언인스톨하고자 한다면 다음의 일련의 커맨드를 입력하면 된다:
# rm /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) # rm /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) # rm /boot/System.map-$(uname -r) # rm /boot/config-$(uname -r) # rm -fr /lib/modules/$(uname -r) # rm /var/lib/initramfs-tools/$(uname -r) # update-grub2 다른 버전의 설치되어있는 커널을 제거하고 싶다면 위의 $(uname -r) 부분을 제거하고자 하는 커널 버전으로 대체하면 된다.</description>

      <description>The importance of physically contiguous memory has increased in modern computing environments, including both low- and high-end systems. Existing physically contiguous memory allocators generally have critical limitations. For example, the most commonly adopted solution, the memory reservation technique, wastes a significant amount of memory space. Scatter/Gather direct memory access (DMA) and input-output memory management units (IOMMUs) avoid this problem by utilizing additional hardware for address space virtualization. However, additional hardware means an increase in costs and power consumption, which is especially disadvantageous for small systems and they do not provide real contiguous memory.</description>

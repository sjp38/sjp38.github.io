      <description>DAMON talk for OSSummit North America 2024 has been accepted and scheduled. The talk will present DAMOS auto-tuning and hopefully, more new DAMO features. The features are still under development, but hopefully, the power of presentation-driven development will make it. ;) Looking forward to meeting you there!</description>

      <description>DAMON talk for OSSummit EU 2023 has accepted and scheduled. The talk will focus on its user-space tool, damo. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly for helping more audiences to digest the content easier, and also for accelerating the development of damo. By the time, hopefully the version of damo would reach to, or exceed 2.0.0, and newer interface and features will be introduced together.
The title of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Data Access Monitoring Operator (DAMO): User-Space Tool/Python Library for Access-Aware Profiling and Optimization of Your Linux Systems&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>[Linux Plumbers Conference 2019] (https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/blog/2019/) 와 함께 열리는 올해의 [Linux Kernel Summit] (https://lwn.net/Articles/788378/) 에 제안한 발표 주제가 accept 되어 9월에 리스본에서 이에 대한 내용을 발표하게 되었습니다. 발표 제목은 &amp;ldquo;Tracing Data Access Pattern with Bounded Overhead and Best-effort Accuracy&amp;rdquo; 입니다.
티켓이 너무 일찍 팔려버리는 바람에 올해는 들으러도 못가나 걱정했는데 갈 수 있게 됐네요, 다행입니다! :D</description>

      <description>지난 토요일, Theodore Ts&amp;rsquo;o 로부터 올해 Linux Plumbers Conference 의 한 트랙으로 열리는 커널 서밋에서 GCMA 발표를 해줄 수 있겠냐는 제의를 받았고 물론 그러겠노라고 했습니다. 발표 일정의 [첫번째 드래프트][1]가 올라왔군요. 화요일 아침에 발표하게 됐습니다.

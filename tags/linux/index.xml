      <description>2022년 마지막 날을 맞아, 저의 간단하고 버그가 많은 스크립트와[1] github 을 통해 저의 오픈소스 커밋 통계를 내봤습니다.
리눅스 커널 통계 리눅스 커널의 메모리 관리 서브시스템과 커널 전체의 2022년 통계를 위해 제 버그 많은 스크립트를[1] 아래와 같이 돌려 봤습니다.
메모리 관리 서브시스템 2022년 한해, 305명의 사람들이 리눅스 커널 메모리 관리 서브시스템 개발에 참여해 81,631 라인의 변경을 2,135 개 커밋으로 만들었습니다.
변경한 라인 수와 커밋 갯수 기준으로 저는 그 305명 가운데 두번째와 (10,537 라인) 세번째로 (106 커밋) 큰 변경을 만들었군요.</description>

      <description>Whenever reading the kernel development statistics report for each release from LWN, I wanted to scope it down to specific subsystems. For that, I wrote a script.
Belows are the top 10 kernel hackers who contributed to the memory management subsystem of Linux kernel, sorted by number of commits and changed (added, deleted, or modified) lines, respectively.
$ ./authors.py ~/linux --file mm/ --since 2021-01-01 --author_identity name --sortby lines --max_nr_authors 10 1.</description>

컴퓨터 시스템에서 물리 메모리는 소중한 자원이어서, 이를 효율적으로 관리하기 위한 많은 노력이 기울여져왔습니다. 이 일은 현대의 시스템에서의 메모리 구조가 복잡해짐에 따라 더 어려워졌습니다. 물리 메모리가 실제로 어떻게 위치해 있는가를 다루기 위한 여러 계층의 추상화가 존재합니다; 그런 추상화 중 하나는 &amp;ldquo;메모리 모델&amp;rdquo; 이라고 불립니다.</description>

      <description>재미 삼아 리눅스 커널 릴리즈 때마다 git history 를 visualize 해서 올리는 유투브 채널[1]을 개설해 봤습니다. 지금은 visualization 에는 gource[2] 를 사용하고 있습니다. 이 비디오를 만드는데 사용되는 스크립트도 GPL v3 로 공개[3]했으니 필요한 분은 사용해 보셔도 좋을 것 같습니다.

      <description>업데이트 (2020-01-01): KUnit 은 v5.5 머지 윈도우 사이 메인라인에 머지되었습니다. 이 포스트 작성 시점 이후로 많은 KUnit 에도 많은 변화가 있었고, 따라서 아래 내용 중 일부, 특히 테스트 셋업과 수행 부분은 좀 많이 달라졌습니다. 해당 내용을 위해선 공식 문서 를 참고하시길 권장합니다. 또한, 최신 버전은 파이썬 버전 종속성이 생겨서 우분투 16.04 위에서는 문제를 겪으실 수 있습니다. 최신버전의 파이썬을 쓰시거나 그냥 우분투 18.04 를 사용하시길 권장합니다.

      <description>Update (2020-01-01): KUnit has merged in v5.5 merge window. From the writing of this post, it had some changes, so below content, especially the test setup and running will not work. Recommend you to refer to the official document in the kernel for detailed tutorial. It also has a python version dependency now, so you would encounter a problem with Ubuntu 16.04. Recommend you to use later Python or Ubuntu 18.</description>

      <description>리눅스 커널은 Formalised and executable memory consistent model 을 제공합니다. 줄여서 linux kernel memory model (LKMM) 이라고 하죠. 이 글은 4.19 버전을 기준으로 LKMM 을 실제로 수행해 보기 위한 환경 셋업 과정과 간단한 실행 방법을 정리해 봅니다. 글 작성을 위한 테스트는 Ubuntu 16.04 서버가 설치된 가상머신에서 진행되었습니다.
herd7 install LKMM 은 버전 7.49 의 &amp;ldquo;herd7&amp;rdquo; 과 &amp;ldquo;klitmus7&amp;rdquo; 을 필요로 합니다. 하지만 herd7 은 또 Ocaml 을 위한 패키지 매니저인 OPAM 을 설치할 것을 필요로 하죠.</description>

Install Dependent Packages $ sudo apt install build-essential libncurses5-dev libssl-dev bc bison flex \ libelf-dev 커널을 빌드하려면 컴파일러와 라이브러리 등이 필요하겠죠. 위 커맨드는 우분투에서 커널 빌드에 필요한 패키지들을 깔아줍니다. 커널 트리의 Documentation/process/changes.rst 에도 커널 빌드에 필요한 패키지들이 나열되어 있으므로, 다른 환경이라면 이를 참고해 필요한 패키지를 설치합시다.</description>

      <description>리눅스 커널의 개발은 커뮤니티 주도입니다. 개발의 한 부분인 테스트 역시 커뮤니티 주도적입니다. 여러 개인 또는 단체가 커널을 각자의 방식으로 테스트 하고 그 결과를 공유합니다. 인텔에서는 0-day 서비스[1] 라는 서비스를 자체적으로 돌리는데, 이 서비스는 최신 리눅스 커널을 가져다가 빌드하고 다양한 기능 / 성능 테스트를 돌리고 그 결과 발견된 regression 을 LKML 에 메일로 보내주는 일을 합니다. 말하자면 Continuous Integration (CI) 이죠.
Linux Kernel Performance (LKP) Tests[2] 는 0-day 서비스에서 기능 / 성능 테스트를 수행하는데 사용되는 도구입니다.</description>

      <description>You can use classical debugger for your Linux kernel programming, though Torvalds doesn&amp;rsquo;t like it. I also do not prefer such use of debuggers, but admit that sometimes debuggers are quite useful. ;)
There are several ways to debug Linux kernel, but one of above is to set up a Linux virtual machine using QEMU and debugging the Linux kernel of the virtual machine from the host machine. This post summarises how to debug the Linux kernel in this way.</description>

      <description>토발즈는 좋아하지 않지만, 리눅스 커널 프로그래밍에도 디버거를 사용할 수 있습니다. 저도 디버거 사용을 좋아하지는 않는 편이지만, 경우에 따라선 디버거를 사용하는게 좋을 때도 있고 취향은 존중되어야죠. ;)
커널 디버깅 방법은 여러가지가 있는데, 그 중 하나는 QEMU 등을 이용한 리눅스 가상 머신을 띄워 두고, 호스트 머신에서 해당 가상 머신의 리눅스 커널을 디버깅 하는 방법입니다. 이 글에선 이렇게 디버깅 하는 방법을 간단히 정리해 봅니다.
테스트 환경 글 작성 과정에서 테스트에 사용한 주요 소프트웨어들과 버전은 다음과 같습니다.</description>

      <description>컨퍼런스 둘째날부터는 kernel summit track 이 시작됩니다. 이번 컨퍼런스 참가는 아무래도 kernel summit 에서의 시끄럽고 정신없는 토론에 참여하고 싶기 때문이었기에 오늘부터가 제게는 가장 재밌는 시간입니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_05/1.jpg)
아침 일찍 일어나 컨퍼런스 장소로 출발합니다. 10명이 함께 묵는 방을 사용하고 있기에 일찍 일어나지 않으면 샤워를 제시간에 하기 어려우므로 조금 일찍 일어났습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_05/2.jpg)
![foo] (/img/osse_05/3.jpg)

일찍 출발한 만큼 일찍 도착. 아직 부스에 사람도 없고 조용하네요. 한동안 부스 한켠에 준비된 휴식 공간에 앉아 커널 메일링 리스트도 읽고 코드도 보고 했습니다.</description>

      <description>드디어 컨퍼런스 첫날입니다. 아침 8시부터 아침식사와 등록이 시작되므로, 7시에 숙소에서 나왔습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_04/1.jpg)
어제는 날이 흐리더니, 오늘은 비도 옵니다. 우산을 챙겨 나옵니다. 그래도 어제 미리 학회장에 들렀던 덕에 길을 헤매지 않고 찾아갈 수 있었습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_04/2.jpg)
빗길을 따라 한참을 걸어서 도착했습니다.
![foo] (/img/osse_04/3.jpg)
![foo] (/img/osse_04/4.jpg)
도착하니 7시 반 정도. 공식 스케쥴은 8시부터 시작이라 아직 한산합니다. 스폰서 부스도 아직 준비중인 곳이 많고, 아직 준비가 덜된 곳도 많습니다. 돌아다니며 인사도 하고 간단한 스몰토크도 하면서 시간을 보냈습니다.</description>

      <description>OSSummit 등록도 마쳤고, 남은 하루는 프라하 성 쪽을 둘러보기로 했습니다. 내일부터는 OSSummit 발표를 아침부터 오후까지 들어야 하므로, 프라하 관광을 해가 떠있을 때 하는건 오늘이 마지막이니 부지런히 걸어야 합니다. 어떻게 생각해 보면 꽤 강행군이기도 하고, 아침 일찍 도착하길 다행이다 싶습니다.

OSSummit 컨퍼런스 회장인 힐튼 프라하 호텔은 프라하 시내의 동북쪽에 위치해 있어서 조금만 걸으면 아침에 심카드 사고 나서 걸었던 블타바 강이 나옵니다. 아까 지나갔던 코스지만 한번 더 걸어가기로 합니다.</description>

먼저 공항에서 입국심사를 거쳐야 합니다. 한글 표지판이 많이 있어서 영어에 익숙지 않은 분들도 비교적 쉽게 적응할 수 있겠다 싶었습니다.
제가 가장 많이 다녀온 외국은 미국인데요. 대한민국 여권 소지자는 미국에 갈 때 비자가 필요없지만 E-SATA 로 등록을 해야 하고, 언젠가부터 E-SATA 등록비도 몇만원 정도 생겼죠. 또, 미국은 입국심사가 왠지 날카롭다는 인상입니다. 입국할 때 입국심사 카드도 써야하고 여기 숙소 주소 등도 적어야 하고, 지문도 찍어야 하죠. 공항 보안검색대에선 투시카메라로 사진도 찍고.</description>

Open Source Summit Europe 과 Embedded Linux Conference Europe, 그리고 Annual Kernel Summit 이 합동으로 열린 프라하에 다녀왔습니다. 이에 대한 기록을 남겨봅니다.
The Event 리눅스 재단에서는 다양한 컨퍼런스를 개최합니다. 2015년까지는 한국에서도 Korea Linux Forum 이라는 행사를 매년 열었죠. 특히 2015년에는 커널 서밋도 함께해서 특히 특별했던 기억입니다. 이런 이벤트들 중에서도 가장 큰 이벤트는 오픈소스 서밋이 아닐까 싶습니다. 이 이벤트는 기존의 리눅스콘 등 행사들이 합쳐진 행사입니다. 가장 큰 이벤트가 오픈소스 서밋이라면 가장 중요한 행사는 커널 서밋이라 할 수 있지 않을까 싶습니다.</description>

      <description>리눅스 커널은 오픈 소스 소프트웨어이므로 그 소스코드가 공개되어 있어 누구나 인터넷을 통해 쉽게 얻을 수 있습니다. 이 글에서는 리눅스 커널 소스코드를 받아올 수 있는 몇가지 방법을 설명합니다.
kernel.org 리눅스 커널 소스 코드를 받아오기 위한 기본적 공식 사이트는 [kernel.org] (https://www.kernel.org) 라 할 수 있겠는데, 이 사이트에는 소스 코드를 포함해 리눅스 커널을 위한 다양한 리소스가 정리되어 있습니다. 이 사이트에 웹브라우저를 통해 들어가보면 첫페이지에서부터 가장 최근에 릴리즈된 버전의 소스코드, 가장 최근의 안정화된 버전의 소스코드 등을 tar.</description>

      <title>Updating Google Chrome on Fedora 23</title>

      <description>I am using Fedora 23 laptop and installed stable version Google Chrome from its official website [0]. In this case, just using Updates of Fedora Software program doesn&amp;rsquo;t update Chrome automatically. For the case, follow below commands to update your Chrome:
$ sudo dnf update google-chrome-stable ... $ sudo killall chrome $ google-chrome-stable The second killall command is necessary because Chrome doesn&amp;rsquo;t kill its process by just cliking Close button. Or, you may reboot your computer but you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t like that.</description>

      <description>랩톱에 Fedora 23 을 깔고 크롬을 공식 홈페이지 [0] 에서 다운받아 메인 브라우저로 사용하고 있습니다. 그런데 이렇게 설치한 경우에는 단순히 Fedora Software 프로그램의 Updates 기능을 통해 업데이트가 되지 않더군요. 이런 경우에는 다음의 커맨드를 통해 직접 업데이트를 할 수 있습니다:
$ sudo dnf update google-chrome-stable ... $ sudo killall chrome $ google-chrome-stable 두번째의 killall 커맨드는 Chrome 프로세스들이 닫기 버튼을 누르는 것만으로는 모두 종료되지 않기 때문에 명시적으로 종료시키기 위해 필요합니다. 컴퓨터를 아예 리붓 하는 방법도 있겠지만 별로 그러고 싶지는 않을테지요.</description>

      <title>Using arping to know ip-MAC mapping</title>

      <description>You can use arping to know IP address to MAC address mapping of your local network. Usage is simple:
arping [-AbDfhqUV] [-c count] [-w deadline] [-s source] -I interface destination For example, you may use the command as below:
$ arping -I eth0 10.0.0.1 ARPING 10.0.0.1 from 10.0.0.2 eth0 Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.123ms Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.251ms ... Secret of the tool is ARP protocol [1]. To know the MAC address of the machine that has a specific IP address, IP protocol layer uses the protocol.</description>

      <description>로컬 네트워크에서 어떤 IP 주소가 어떤 MAC 어드레스에 매핑되는지 알기 위해 arping 을 사용할 수 있습니다. 사용법은 간단합니다:
arping [-AbDfhqUV] [-c count] [-w deadline] [-s source] -I interface destination 예를 들면, 다음과 같습니다:
$ arping -I eth0 10.0.0.1 ARPING 10.0.0.1 from 10.0.0.2 eth0 Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.123ms Unicast reply from 10.0.0.1 [11:22:33:44:55:66] 0.251ms ... 이 툴의 동작 원리는 ARP 프로토콜 [1] 입니다. IP 프로토콜 레이어는 이 프로토콜을 사용해 특정 IP 주소를 사용하는 기계의 MAC 어드레스를 파악하고 이 주소를 아랫단의 Ethernet 레이어에 보냅니다.</description>

      <description>테스트 등을 위해 소스코드로부터 커널을 직접 빌드, 설치하기 시작하면 어느새 수많은 커널이 설치되어 있는 것을 확인할 수 있다. 삭제를 위해선 make install 로 만들어진 파일들을 직접 제거하고 grub 을 업데이트 해줘야 한다.
예를 들어 시스템이 현재 부팅되어 있는 버전의 커널을 언인스톨하고자 한다면 다음의 일련의 커맨드를 입력하면 된다:
# rm /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r) # rm /boot/initrd.img-$(uname -r) # rm /boot/System.map-$(uname -r) # rm /boot/config-$(uname -r) # rm -fr /lib/modules/$(uname -r) # rm /var/lib/initramfs-tools/$(uname -r) # update-grub2 다른 버전의 설치되어있는 커널을 제거하고 싶다면 위의 $(uname -r) 부분을 제거하고자 하는 커널 버전으로 대체하면 된다.</description>

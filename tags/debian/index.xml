      <title>UTM-based Linux kernel development environment on Macbook Pro</title>

      <description>I got a Macbook Pro. I was wondering if I can do kernel development on it since I recently learned that modern small computers are fast enough to be used for frequent kernel builds. I also heard a few of my previous colleague kernel developers use their Macbook for kernel builds.
Unfortunately I cannot install Linux kernel on the laptop at the moment, though. I hence created a Debian13 VM on it using UTM and ran the kernel compile benchmark.</description>

      <description>A few weeks ago I heard modern normal computers can build kernel faster than I expected. My 10 years old personal laptop (Thinkpad X1) used to build a kernel per a couple of hours. The last time I built kernel on the laptop was about 8 years ago. Since then, I was always using only workstation or server level machines for building kernels.
So I wanted to know how good modern normal desktop-level machines are, by myself.</description>

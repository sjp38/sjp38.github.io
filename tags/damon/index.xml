      <description>DAMON talk for OSSummit EU 2023 has accepted and scheduled. The talk will focus on its user-space tool, damo. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly for helping more audiences to digest the content easier, and also for accelerating the development of damo. By the time, hopefully the version of damo would reach to, or exceed 2.0.0, and newer interface and features will be introduced together.
The title of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Data Access Monitoring Operator (DAMO): User-Space Tool/Python Library for Access-Aware Profiling and Optimization of Your Linux Systems&amp;rdquo;.</description>

DAMON is lightweight. It increases system memory usage by 0.39% and slows target workloads down by 1.16%.
DAMON is accurate and useful for memory management optimizations. An experimental DAMON-based operation scheme for THP, namely &amp;rsquo;ethp&amp;rsquo;, removes 76.15% of THP memory overheads while preserving 51.25% of THP speedup. Another experimental DAMON-based &amp;lsquo;proactive reclamation&amp;rsquo; implementation, namely &amp;lsquo;prcl&amp;rsquo;, reduces 93.</description>

2022 was a year of active and healthy DAMON development.
Seven new DAMON major features were delivered to users. Some of those were featured in articles and academic papers.
It was possible thanks to the DAMON community. The community has expanded with its own mailing list and an open bi-weekly chat series. 40 people contributed their great code to DAMON via making their 275 commits merged into the mainline.</description>

      <title>An example of DAMON usage for profiling</title>

      <description>I realized I didn&amp;rsquo;t introduce a good, intuitive example use case of DAMON[0] for profiling so far, though DAMON is not for only profiling. One straightforward and realistic usage of DAMON as a profiling tool would be recording the monitoring results with callstack and visualize those by timeline together.
For example, below shows that visualization for a realistic workload, namely &amp;lsquo;fft&amp;rsquo; in SPLASH-2X benchmark suite. The upper-most graph shows how DAMON-detected working set size of the workload (y-axis) changes by time (x-axis).</description>

      <description>DAMON[0] 이 프로파일링만을 위한 건 아니지만, DAMON 을 프로파일링에 활용하는 방법에 대한 괜찮은 직관적 예를 여태 소개한 적이 없다는 걸 깨달았습니다. 간단하지만 현실적인 DAMON 의 프로파일링 도구로써의 사용법은 모니터링 결과를 콜스택과 함께 기록한 후 시간대에 맞춰 시각화 하는 것입니다.
예를 들어, 아래 그림은 SPLASH-2X 벤치마크의 &amp;lsquo;fft&amp;rsquo; 라는 워크로드에 대한 그런 시각화 결과입니다. 여기서, 우린 이 워크로드에 세개의 폭발적 메모리 액세스가 이루어지는 구간이 있는 것을 알 수 있으며, FFT1DOnce.cons::prop.2() 가 그 첫번째와 두번째 구간에, 그리고 Transpose() 는 세번째 구간에 연관되어 있음을 알 수 있습니다.</description>

      <description>DAMON 은 kselftest 와 kunit 에 기반한 여러 테스트를 자신의 패치셋에 포함시켜 두고 있습니다. 커널 트리에 위치하는 테스트는 짧은 수행시간만 가지는게 바람직하므로, 시간을 오래 소요하는 테스트들을 패키지화 해서 저희 회사 내에서만 사용해 오고 있었습니다. 테스트는 좋은 문서로 사용될 수 있고 컨트리뷰터들에게도 필요하죠. 그런 이유로, 이 패키지를 오픈소스로 만들겠다고 지난 커널 서밋 발표에서 이야기 했었습니다 (https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/7/contributions/659/).
어제, 이 패키지 를 마침내 GPL v2 라이센스의 오픈소스로 릴리즈 했습니다. 이제 DAMON 인터페이스를 이해하고 여러분의 기계 위에서 스스로 DAMON 을 테스트 하는데 이 패키지를 사용하실 수 있습니다.</description>

      <description>DAMON contains a number of tests based on the kselftest and kunit in its patchset itself. As it is preferred to contain only tests having short runtime in kernel tree, I organized time consuming tests in a package and used it in my company only. Tests could be used as a good document and essential for contributors. For the reason, I promised I will make it open source in the last kernel summit talk (https://linuxplumbersconf.</description>

      <description>DAMON 소개를 위한 웹사이트[1] 를 열었습니다.
DAMON 공식 문서[2], 실제에 가까운 여러 워크로드의 힙[3], mmap() 된 영역[4], 그리고 스택[5] 에 대한 히트맵 포맷의 동적 액세스 패턴들, 동적 워킹셋 사이즈의 분포[6] 와 시간대에 따른 워킹셋 사이즈의 변화양상[7], 그리고 성능 테스트 결과[8] 를 확인해 보실 수 있습니다.

With increasingly data-intensive workloads and limited DRAM capacity, optimal memory management based on dynamic access patterns is becoming increasingly important. Such mechanisms are only possible if accurate and efficient dynamic access pattern monitoring is available.
DAMON is a Data Access MONitoring framework subsystem for the Linux kernel developed for such memory management. It is designed with some key mechanism (refer to Design for the detail) that make it</description>

      <description>With the upload of the accepted papers list, EuroSys homepage also updated its notice about COVID-19 related notification. It previously tried to reschedule the offline meeting, however seems they changed mind and decided to do virtual (online) conference. It&amp;rsquo;s a bad news for authors and people who planned to participate the offline meetings, but a good new for other people, because they would be allowed to participate in the conference without fee.</description>

      <description>Accepted paper 리스트 업로드와 함께 EuroSys 홈페이지의 COVID-19 관련 공지도 업데이트 되었습니다. 이전에는 오프라인 미팅 일정을 재조정하려 하고 있다 했지만, 가상 (온라인) 컨퍼런스로 치루기로 결정되었나봅니다. 논문 저자들과 오프라인 미팅을 참여하려고 했던 사람들에겐 안좋은 소식입니다만 다른 사람들에겐 좋은 소식이기도 합니다, 무료로 컨퍼런스에 참여할 수 있을테니까요.</description>

      <title>RCX: Read-Copy Transact</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/ko/rcx/</link>

      <description>Read-copy update (RCU) can provide ideal scalability for read-mostly workloads, but some believe that it provides only poor performance for updates. This belief is due to the lack of RCU-centric update synchronization mechanisms. RCU instead works with a range of update-side mechanisms, such as locking. In fact, many developers embrace simplicity by using global locking. Logging, hardware transactional memory, or fine-grained locking can provide better scalability, but each of these approaches has limitations, such as imposing overhead on readers or poor scalability on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems, mainly due to their lack of NUMA-aware design principles.</description>

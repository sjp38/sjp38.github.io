      <description>DAMON talk for OSSummit EU 2023 has accepted and scheduled. The talk will focus on its user-space tool, damo. It&amp;rsquo;s mainly for helping more audiences to digest the content easier, and also for accelerating the development of damo. By the time, hopefully the version of damo would reach to, or exceed 2.0.0, and newer interface and features will be introduced together.
The title of the talk is &amp;ldquo;Data Access Monitoring Operator (DAMO): User-Space Tool/Python Library for Access-Aware Profiling and Optimization of Your Linux Systems&amp;rdquo;.</description>

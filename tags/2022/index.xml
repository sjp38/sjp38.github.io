      <description>&lt;p&gt;A summary of DAMON development in 2022 has posted:
&lt;a href=&#34;https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20221229171209.162356-1-sj@kernel.org/&#34;&gt;https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20221229171209.162356-1-sj@kernel.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2022 was a year of active and healthy DAMON development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven new DAMON major features were delivered to users. Some of those were
featured in articles and academic papers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was possible thanks to the DAMON community. The community has expanded with
its own mailing list and an open bi-weekly chat series. 40 people contributed
their great code to DAMON via making their 275 commits merged into the
mainline. About 33% of the commits were made by Amazon-external contributors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The amount of DAMON changes in 2022 (v5.15..v6.2-rc1) was not that tiny
compared to other subsystems. About 0.2% of the commits for whole Linux tree
was for DAMON. Among the changes for DAMON&amp;rsquo;s parent subsystem, mm, about 8% of
commits and 14% of lines of changes were made for DAMON.&lt;/p&gt;

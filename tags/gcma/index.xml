      <title>GCMA: Guaranteed Contiguous Memory Allocator</title>

      <description>GCMA (Guaranteed Contiguous Memory Allocator) is a contiguous memory allocator for Linux kernel that guarantees fast latency, success of allocation, and reasonable system memory utilization. Our evaluation on Raspberry Pi 2 shows 15 to 130 times faster and more predictable allocation latency without system performance degradation compared to Linux v3.18 default CMA.
The project has been introduced by Linux Foundation Korea Forum 2014[1] and Embedded Operating Systems Workshop 2015[2]. A paper about the project has been published by proceeding of Embedded Operating Systems Workshop 2015 and 45th issue of ACM SIGBED Review[3].</description>

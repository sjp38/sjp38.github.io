      <description>This document helps you estimating the amount of benefit that you could get from DAMON-based system optimizations, and describes how you could achieve it.
Check The Signs No optimization can provide same extent of benefit to every case. Therefore you should first guess how much improvements you could get using DAMON. If some of below conditions match your situation, you could consider using DAMON.
Low IPC and High Cache Miss Ratios.</description>

DAMON is lightweight. It increases system memory usage by 0.39% and slows target workloads down by 1.16%.
DAMON is accurate and useful for memory management optimizations. An experimental DAMON-based operation scheme for THP, namely &amp;rsquo;ethp&amp;rsquo;, removes 76.15% of THP memory overheads while preserving 51.25% of THP speedup. Another experimental DAMON-based &amp;lsquo;proactive reclamation&amp;rsquo; implementation, namely &amp;lsquo;prcl&amp;rsquo;, reduces 93.</description>

      <description>A summary of DAMON development in 2022 has posted: https://lore.kernel.org/damon/20221229171209.162356-1-sj@kernel.org/
2022 was a year of active and healthy DAMON development.
Seven new DAMON major features were delivered to users. Some of those were featured in articles and academic papers.
It was possible thanks to the DAMON community. The community has expanded with its own mailing list and an open bi-weekly chat series. 40 people contributed their great code to DAMON via making their 275 commits merged into the mainline.</description>

      <title>Linux Memory Management Subsystem Development Statistics in 2021 (Short)</title>

      <description>Whenever reading the kernel development statistics report for each release from LWN, I wanted to scope it down to specific subsystems. For that, I wrote a script.
Belows are the top 10 kernel hackers who contributed to the memory management subsystem of Linux kernel, sorted by number of commits and changed (added, deleted, or modified) lines, respectively.
$ ./authors.py ~/linux --file mm/ --since 2021-01-01 --author_identity name --sortby lines --max_nr_authors 10 1.</description>

      <title>DAMON 테스트 패키지가 GPL v2 로 릴리즈 되었습니다</title>

      <description>DAMON 은 kselftest 와 kunit 에 기반한 여러 테스트를 자신의 패치셋에 포함시켜 두고 있습니다. 커널 트리에 위치하는 테스트는 짧은 수행시간만 가지는게 바람직하므로, 시간을 오래 소요하는 테스트들을 패키지화 해서 저희 회사 내에서만 사용해 오고 있었습니다. 테스트는 좋은 문서로 사용될 수 있고 컨트리뷰터들에게도 필요하죠. 그런 이유로, 이 패키지를 오픈소스로 만들겠다고 지난 커널 서밋 발표에서 이야기 했었습니다 (https://linuxplumbersconf.org/event/7/contributions/659/).
어제, 이 패키지 를 마침내 GPL v2 라이센스의 오픈소스로 릴리즈 했습니다. 이제 DAMON 인터페이스를 이해하고 여러분의 기계 위에서 스스로 DAMON 을 테스트 하는데 이 패키지를 사용하실 수 있습니다.</description>

      <description>DAMON contains a number of tests based on the kselftest and kunit in its patchset itself. As it is preferred to contain only tests having short runtime in kernel tree, I organized time consuming tests in a package and used it in my company only. Tests could be used as a good document and essential for contributors. For the reason, I promised I will make it open source in the last kernel summit talk (https://linuxplumbersconf.</description>

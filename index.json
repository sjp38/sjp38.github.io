This belief is due to the lack of RCU-centric update synchronization mechanisms. RCU instead works with a range of update-side mechanisms, such as locking. In fact, many developers embrace simplicity by using global locking. Logging, hardware transactional memory, or fine-grained locking can provide better scalability, but each of these approaches has limitations, such as imposing overhead on readers or poor scalability on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems, mainly due to their lack of NUMA-aware design principles.\nThis project introduces an RCU extension (RCX) that provides highly scalable RCU updates on NUMA systems while retaining RCU’s read-side benefits. RCX combines hardware transactional memory (HTM) and traditional locking based on our NUMA-aware design principles for RCU. Micro-benchmarks on a NUMA system having 144 hardware threads show RCX has up to 22.61 times better performance and up to 145.00 times lower HTM abort rates compared to a state-of-the-art RCU/HTM combination. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of RCX, we have applied RCX to parallelize some of the Linux kernel memory management system and an in-memory database system. The optimized kernel and the database show up to 24 and 17 times better performance compared to the original version, respectively.\nNews 2020-04-19: The EuroSys'20 paper is uploaded at ACM DL.\n2020-04-04: The accepted papers list of EuroSys'20 has uploaded\n2020-02-14: The paper introducing RCX has accepted to be presented by EuroSys'20.\nSource Code The source code of RCX is available at: https://github.com/rcx-sync.\nPublications and Presentations  SeongJae Park, Paul E.

In that case, git send-email automatically add From: line pointing the real author of the patch in the body of the mail so that maintainers applying the patches can set the author information correctly.\nFor example, if \u0026ldquo;Alice alice@abc.com\u0026rdquo; has made a commit and \u0026ldquo;Bob bob@abc.com\u0026rdquo; formats the commit into a patch file and sends it, git send-email automatically adds From: Alice \u0026lt;alice@abc.com\u0026gt; line in the body of the mail. And, when a maintainer is applying the patch using git am, the patch is applied with author \u0026ldquo;Alice alice@abc.com\u0026rdquo;.\nHowever, please note that git send-email knows the situation by comparing the author information and the command caller\u0026rsquo;s git user eamil configuration or given \u0026lsquo;\u0026ndash;from\u0026rsquo; option only, not considering real smtp email account.\nFor example, suppose that Alice has two email accounts, alice@abc.com and alice@def.com. And, Alice wants to use alice@abc.com as her email address in the git history, but needs to send her patches using def.com SMTP server. She might use below commands.\n$ git config sendemail.smtpserver smtp.def.com $ git config sendemail.smtpuser alice@def.com $ git config user.email \u0026quot;alice@abc.com\u0026quot; $ git commit -as -m 'the patch' $ git format-patch HEAD^ $ git send-email 0001_the_patch.patch Because her git config is saying the user.email is alice@abc.com and the patch is authored by alice@abc.com, git send-email thinks same people is sending the patch. Thus, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add the \u0026lsquo;From:\u0026rsquo; line in the body of the mail. Of course, git send-email tries to set the from of the mail as alice@abc.com, but as the additionally specified \u0026lsquo;from\u0026rsquo; information is usually (at least gmail does) ignored by the SMTP server, the maintainer will receive the mail saying author email as \u0026lsquo;alice@def.com\u0026rsquo; only.\nNote that git send-email considers the email address it tries to use as the from address, not the final one that SMTP server will use. Thus, this problem can be worked around in weird way using the --from option of the git send-email. In the above case, giving --from \u0026quot;Alice \u0026lt;alice@def.com\u0026gt;\u0026quot; option to git send-email makes the command to think the sender is not the author (alice@abc.com) and as a result, it adds the From: line in the body.\nAlso, please note that adding --from option does not always add the From: line in the body. Rather than that, it can even hide the From: line you intended to add, if you give the address that same with the commit\u0026rsquo;s author, regardless of what SMTP server you use. For example,\n$ git config sendemail.smtpserver smtp.def.com $ git config sendemail.smtpuser alice@def.com $ git config user.email \u0026quot;alice@abc.com\u0026quot; $ git commit -as -m 'the patch' $ git format-patch HEAD^ $ git config user.email \u0026quot;alice@def.com\u0026quot; $ git send-email --from alice@abc.com 0001_the_patch.patch If the final command had no --from option, it would added the From: in-body line. However, because it specifies the real author address using --from option, git send-email thinks the real author is sending this mail and omits the From: line in the body.\n","date":1578341405,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1578341405,"objectID":"64c49bd057c2017137916aab2db1d0cf","permalink":"/post/git_send_email_multiple_email_caution/","publishdate":"2020-01-06T21:10:05+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/git_send_email_multiple_email_caution/","section":"post","summary":"In some case, we need to send patches that made by other people instead. git send-email command can know this situation by itself by comparing the commit author information and mail sender\u0026rsquo;s information.

The Linux kernel community would be a good example. In the style, all major communications are made by email only. Patches are submitted to the maintainers and one more open mailing lists as a mail.

This can be awful or even impossible on some mail clients.\nGit can help formatting and sending your patch files using SMTP. This post describes how you can use git to send email.\nPackage Install If you installed git using the package manager, you should install not only git package, but also git-email package. If you are using apt package manager, simply type $ sudo apt install git-email on the terminal.\nSMTP Setting Then, set smtp server configurations for you. Of course, you should enable the smtp configuration on your mail accout first. If your mail account is ready for the smtp, now you should let git to know how it can access to your mail account using \u0026lsquo;git config\u0026rsquo;. If you want to use your Gmail account, it will be as below:\n$ git config --global sendemail.smtpserver smtp.gmail.com $ git config --global sendemail.smtpserverport 587 $ git config --global sendemail.smtpencryption tls $ git config --global sendemail.smtpuser \u0026lt;your-gmail-account@gmail.com\u0026gt; You can also set the mail account password as below, but I will recommend you to not store your password in that way, because it can harm your security.\n$ git config --global sendemail.smtppass \u0026lt;your_password\u0026gt; Send Mail Sending mail is so easy. You should first save your mail message in a file. This could be patch file, which can also easily formatted using git format-patch. After that, make sure you know who you want your mail to be sent to. Now, just type below command.\n$ git send-email --to \u0026lt;recipients\u0026gt; \u0026lt;the file containing your message\u0026gt; If you have not set your password (again, I recommend you do not save your password), this command will ask your password. Just type it on the prompt. Then, your mail will delivered to the recipients you specified.\nFor more detail, $ git help send-email.\nConclusion Summarised how you can send email using Git.

Despite this trend, the capacity of DRAM has not been increased enough to accommodate such huge working sets. Therefore, memory management mechanisms optimized for such modern workloads are widely required today. For such optimizations, knowing the data access pattern of given workloads is essential. However, manually extracting such patterns from huge and complex workloads is exhaustive. Worse yet, existing memory access analysis tools incur unacceptably high overheads for unnecessarily detailed analysis results.\nTo mitigate this situation, we introduce a tool that is designed for data access pattern tracing. Two core mechanisms in this tool, a region-based sampling and an adaptive region adjustment, allow users to limit the tracing overhead in a bounded range regardless of the size and complexity of target workloads, while preserving the quality of results. Our empirical evaluations that conducted with 20 realistic workloads show the high quality, low overhead, and a potential use case of this tool.\nSource Code The source code of DAMON for the next and the latest releases are available. Note that the source trees are frequently rebased.

For example:\n$ sudo ../qemu/build/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -smp 2 \\ -enable-kvm -drive if=virtio,file=debian.img,cache=none \\ -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2242-:22 -net nic -nographic \\ -kernel /linux.out/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \\ -append “root=/dev/vda1 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 debug ignore_loglevel ftrace_dump_on_oops” For the root= in the kernel parameter, check which device file is mounted as the rootfs by the guest OS and use it.\nAlso, you cannot use modules built on the host in the VM, unless you send the module binary files into the VM. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that, simply build the modules you need in static. For example, as this post uses the ssh, I statically built the ethernet driver.\nImage Resize The guest os disk might be full soon, if you configured it too small. You can enlarge the qcow2 image\u0026rsquo;s size as below:\n$ qemu-img resize qc2img +160G $ sudo apt install libguestfs-tools $ cp qc2img qc2img.bak $ sudo virt-resize --expand /dev/sda1 qc2img.bak qc2img $ sudo virt-resize --expand /dev/sda1 qc2img.bak qc2img [ 0.0] Examining qc2img.bak ◓ 25% ⟦▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════⟧ --:-- 100% ⟦▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒⟧ 00:00 ****** Summary of changes: /dev/sda1: This partition will be resized from 24.0G to 184.0G.

Minsky 는 MIT Media Lab 창시자이자 A.I 선도자였으며, 2016년에 사망했습니다. 스톨만은 한 메일링 리스트에서 (Minsky 를 성폭행으로 비난하는 어느 시위 주도자의 주장에 대한 답변으로) 이렇게 주장했습니다, 자신도 Epstein 은 비난하지만, Minsky 는 그녀가 강요당한 걸 몰랐을 가능성이 있다구요:\n많은 시나리오를 상상해 볼 수 있겠습니다만, 가장 그럴싸한 시나리오는 그에게는 그녀가 스스로 원해서 그러는듯 보였을 거라는 겁니다. Epstein 이 그녀를 강요했다면, 그는 그가 연관된 것을 그녀가 감추도록 해야 했을 겁니다. 일부 SJW 는 \u0026ldquo;Remove Richard Stallman\u0026rdquo; 이라는 Medium 포스트를 작성했습니다. Vice 와 The Daily Beast 와 같은 미디어 직판장은 Stallman 이 그 여성이 \u0026ldquo;완전히 원했다\u0026rdquo; 그리고 \u0026ldquo;Epstein 을 방어하고 있다\u0026rdquo; 라고 했다고 거짓말하고 그의 발언을 잘못된 의미로 인용했습니다. Stallman 은 이제 MIT 에서 사퇴하라는 압력을 받고 있습니다.\n더 나아가서 이 증언에 그녀가 Minsky 와 성관계를 가졌다는 이야기는 없고, Epstein 이 그녀에게 그러라 했을 뿐이라는 이야기만 있습니다, 그리고 물리학자 Greg Benford 에 따르면 그녀가 Minsky 를 유혹했고 그는 그녀를 거절했다고 합니다:\n내가 알죠, 내가 거기 있었습니다. Minsky 는 그녀를 거절했고, 제게 그 이야기를 했습니다. 그녀는 우리가 이야기 하는걸 보았고 제게 다가오지 않았습니다. 이는 Stallman 의 생각에 대한 완전한 검증 같습니다. Minsky 가 무엇을 알았는지가 중요치 않다면, \u0026ldquo;Minsky 가 한 여성을 성폭행 했다\u0026rdquo; 와 \u0026ldquo;Epstein 이 17살 여성에게 그의 강요를 Minsky 에게 알리지 않은 채 성행위를 가지라 했다\u0026rdquo; 사이에 차이가 없다면, 왜 그는 그녀를 거절했을까요?\n추가 수정: 그는 그가 설립한 Free Software Foundation 에서도 사임했습니다. 자유 소프트웨어에의 우울한 소식입니다, 저는 Stallman 같은 순수한 믿음을 가진 사람이 다양한 종류의 피해야할 선택을 막는데 필수적이라 생각하거든요.\n Context: In a recently unsealed deposition a woman testified that, at the age of 17, Epstein told her to have sex with Marvin Minsky. Minsky was a founder of the MIT Media Lab and pioneer in A.I. who died in 2016. Stallman argued on a mailing list (in response to a statement from a protest organizer accusing Minsky of sexual assault) that, while he condemned Epstein, Minsky likely did not know she was being coerced:\nWe can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates. Some SJW responded by writing a Medium post called \u0026ldquo;Remove Richard Stallman\u0026rdquo;. Media outlets like Vice and The Daily Beast then lied and misquoted Stallman as saying that the woman was likely \u0026ldquo;entirely willing\u0026rdquo; and as \u0026ldquo;defending Epstein\u0026rdquo;. He has now been pressured to resign from MIT\nFurthermore the deposition doesn\u0026rsquo;t say she had sex with Minsky, only that Epstein told her to do so, and according to physicist Greg Benford she propositioned Minsky and he turned her down:\nI know; I was there.

Linux 1.3.50 에서 mem_map 의 원소들은 마침내 struct page 로 이름지어졌습니다.\n이 평평한 메모리 매핑은 물리 페이지 프레임 번호 (page-frame number : PFN) 와 그에 대응되는 struct page 사이의 쉽고 빠른 변환을 제공했습니다; 이 변환 작업은 간단한 배열 인덱스 계산 문제였습니다. 이후 struct page 의 레이아웃 변경이 있었는데, 새로운 사용처 (예컨대, page cache) 들과 struct page 의 캐시 성능 최적화를 위한 것이었습니다. 메모리 매핑은 깔끔하고 효율적인 평평한 배열로 유지되었습니다만, 이는 중요한 단점을 가지고 있었습니다: 물리 주소 공간 상의 큰 공백을 처리할 수 없었습니다. 이 메모리 매핑 가운데 공백에 연관된 부분은 낭비되어지거나, ARM 에서처럼, 메모리 매핑 자체가 공백을 가질 수 있었습니다.\nDISCONTIGMEM 상당히 비연속적인 물리 메모리를 효율적으로 처리하기 위한 지원이 리눅스를 NUMA 기계들 위에서 잘 동작하도록 하기 위한 노력의 일환으로 1999년에 메모리 관리 서브시스템으로 들어왔습니다. 이 코드는 CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM 설정 옵션에 종속적이어서, 이 메모리 모델은 DISCONTIGMEM 이라 이름지어진 첫번째 모델이었습니다.\n이 DISCONTIGMEM 모델은 메모리 노드 (memory node) 라는 개념을 소개했는데, 이 개념은 여전히 NUMA 메모리 관리의 기본으로 남아있습니다. 각 노드는 free-page lists, in-use page lists, least-recently-used (LRU) 정보, 사용 통계 등을 포함한, (대부분) 독립적인 메모리 관리 서브시스템을 갖습니다. 이런 것들 가운데, struct pglist_data (또는 짧게 pg_data_t) 로 표현되는 노드 데이터는 하나의 노드에 대한 메모리 매핑 정보를 가지고 있습니다. 각 노드가 연속적인 물리 메모리를 가지고 있다는 가정 하에, 노드당 하나의 struct page 배열을 갖는 것은 평평한 메모리 매핑 안의 거대한 공백 문제를 해결했습니다.\n하지만 이게 공짜로 된 건 아닙니다. DISCONTIGMEM 에서는, 예를 들면 어떤 PFN 을 그에 연관된 struct page 로 변환하기 위해 특정 페이지를 어떤 노드가 가지고 있는지를 알 수 있어야 합니다. 비슷하게, 페이지를 가지고 PFN 을 구하기 위해 어떤 노드의 메모리 맵이 해당 struct page 를 가지고 있는지도 알 수 있어야 합니다. 긴 진화의 끝에, KVADDR_TO_NID(), LOCAL_MAP_BASE(), ADDR_TO_MAPBASE(), 그리고 LOCAL_BASE_ADDR() 매크로를 처음 정의한 mips64 부터 시작해서 PFN 의 struct page 로의 변환과 그 반대 작업은 include/asm-generic/memory_model.h 안에 정의된, 비교적 간단한 pfn_to_page() 와 page_to_pfn() 매크로로 수행되게 되었습니다.\n하지만, DISCONTIGMEM 은 약점이 있었습니다: 메모리 핫플러그 (hotplug) 와 핫리무브 (hot remove) 입니다. 실제 NUMA 노드는 실제 핫플러그를 지원하기엔 너무 굵은 크기였고, 노드를 쪼개는 것은 불필요한게 많은 단편화와 오버헤드를 가져올 것이었습니다. 각 노드가 독립적인 메모리 관리 구조체들을 연관된 비용과 함께 가짐을 기억해 보세요; 노드를 쪼개는 것은 그런 비용을 상당히 증가시킬 겁니다.\nSPARSEMEM 이 한계는 SPARSEMEM 을 통해 해결되었습니다. 이 모델은 메모리 매핑을 아키텍쳐별로 정의된 임의의 크기의 섹션들의 집합으로 추상화 했습니다. 각 섹션은 struct mem_section 으로 표현되며, (코드에 설명된 바에 따르면): \u0026ldquo;논리적으로, struct page 의 배열로의 포인터입니다. 하지만, 다른 마술을 통해 저장됩니다\u0026rdquo;. 이 섹션들의 배열은 SECTION_SIZE 크기로 효율적으로 쪼개질 수 있는 메타 메모리 매핑입니다. PFN 과 struct page 사이의 효율적인 변환을 위해, PFN 의 상위 비트 몇개는 이 섹션 배열로의 인덱스로 사용됩니다. 반대 방향 변환을 위해선, 이 섹션 넘버가 page 의 flag 로 인코딩 됩니다.\n이 모델이 리눅스 커널에 소개되고 몇달 후, SPARSEMEM 은 SPARSEMEM_EXTREME 으로 확장되었는데, 이 모델은 산재하는 물리 주소 공간을 갖는 시스템에 적합합니다. SPARSEMEM_EXTREME 에서는, 첫번째 레벨은 mem_section 구조체들로의 포인터가 되고, 실제 mem_section 객체는 실제로 꽂힌 물리 메모리에 기반해서 동적으로 할당됩니다.\n2007년에 SPARSEMEM 의 또다른 개선이 이루어졌습니다; 이는 SPARSEMEM 의 일반적인 가상 메모리 매핑 지원 또는 SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 이라고 불렸습니다. SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 의 아이디어는 전체 메모리 매핑이 가상 연속 공간에 매핑되어 있지만, 활성화된 섹션들만이 물리 페이지로 연결되어 있도록 하자는 것입니다. 이 모델은 32-bit 시스템에서는 물리 메모리의 크기가 가상 주소 공간을 넘을 수 있기 때문에 잘 동작하지 못할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 64-bit 시스템에서 SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 은 확실히 우수합니다. 추가적인 페이지 테이블 엔트리 사용이라는 비용 아래, page_to_pfn() 과 pfn_to_page() 는 평평한 모델만큼이나 간단해 졌습니다.\nSPARSEMEM 메모리 모델의 마지막 확장은 꽤 최근 (2016) 이었습니다; 이는 persistent 메모리 디바이스의 사용 증가로 인해 이루어졌습니다. 메모리 매핑을 메인 메모리가 아니라 그런 디바이스들 내에 직접 저장하는 걸 지원하기 위해, 이 가상 메모리 매핑은 struct vmem_altmap 을 사용할 수 있게 되었는데, 이 구조체는 persistent 메모리 안의 페이지 구조체를 제공합니다.\n2005년으로 돌아가보면, SPARSEMEM 은 \u0026ldquo;새로운, 그리고 실험적인 discontiguous memory 의 대체재\u0026rdquo; 로 설명되었습니다. SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 을 추가한 커밋은 그것을 \u0026ldquo;우리가 SPARSEMEM 을 대부분의 시스템에 기본 (그리고 유일한) 옵션이 되게 할 가능성이 있다\u0026rdquo; 고 했습니다. 그리고 실제로, 일부 아키텍쳐는 DISCONTIGMEM 에서 SPARSEMEM 으로 옮겨탔습니다. 2008년, SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 은 x86-64 를 위한 유일한 메모리 모델이 되었는데, FLATMEM 보단 조금 비싸지만 DISCONTIGMEM 보다는 효율적이기 때문입니다.\n메모리 핫플러그, persistent 메모리 지원, 다양한 성능 최적화와 같은 최근의 메모리 관리 분야 개발은 모두 SPARSEMEM 모델을 타겟으로 하고 있습니다. 하지만 과거의 모델들은 여전히 존재해서, 아키텍쳐와 메모리 관리 코드 상의 많은 #ifdef 블록의 존재와, 관련된 구성 옵션의 특별한 미로의 존재라는 추가비용을 유발하고 있습니다. 남아있는 DISCONTIGMEM 사용자들을 SPARSEMEM 으로 완전히 바꿔타게 하려는 노력들이 있습니다만, ia64 나 mips64 와 같은 아키텍쳐들을 그렇게 변화시키기는 쉬운 작업이 아닐 겁니다. 그리고 ARC 아키텍쳐의 DISCONTIGMEM 사용은 \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; 메모리 아래 \u0026ldquo;high memory\u0026rdquo; 영역의 존재를 갖는데, 이는 분명 변경하기 어려울 겁니다.\n","date":1564526717,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564526717,"objectID":"9b100f7f72cd756f45d0974ee1d1b0ec","permalink":"/post/lwn_memory_flat_discontiguous_sparse/","publishdate":"2019-07-31T07:45:17+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/lwn_memory_flat_discontiguous_sparse/","section":"post","summary":"LWN 의 \u0026ldquo;Memory: the flat, the discontiguous, and the sparse\u0026rdquo; 라는 제목의 글의 한글 번역입니다. 원문은 LWN 에서 볼 수 있습니다: https://lwn.net/Articles/789304/\n May 27, 2019\n이 기사는 Mike Rapoport 에 의해 기여되었습니다.\n컴퓨터 시스템에서 물리 메모리는 소중한 자원이어서, 이를 효율적으로 관리하기 위한 많은 노력이 기울여져왔습니다. 이 일은 현대의 시스템에서의 메모리 구조가 복잡해짐에 따라 더 어려워졌습니다. 물리 메모리가 실제로 어떻게 위치해 있는가를 다루기 위한 여러 계층의 추상화가 존재합니다; 그런 추상화 중 하나는 \u0026ldquo;메모리 모델\u0026rdquo; 이라고 불립니다.","tags":["lwn","linux","kernel","memory models","translation","lwn translations"],"title":"Memory: the flat, the discontiguous, and the sparse (Korean)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["lkml news"],"content":"[PATCH v6 0/5] Introduce MADV_COLD and MADV_PAGEOUT https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190723062539.198697-1-minchan@kernel.org\n어플리케이션의 메모리를 좀 더 적극적으로 reclaim 시킴으로써 반응성을 높이기 위한 패치셋의 일부를 따로 떼어낸, MADV_COLD 와 MADV_PAGEOUT 힌트를 madvise() 에 추가하는 패치의 여섯번째 버전입니다.\n일곱번째 버전도 빠르게 올라왔군요: https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190726023435.214162-1-minchan@kernel.org 단순히 mmotm 최신 버전 위로 리베이스 한 것 같네요.\n[PATCH v9 00/21] Generic page walk and ptdump https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190722154210.42799-1-steven.price@arm.com\nx86 과 arm64 가 범용적 페이지 테이블 워킹을 하도록 했던 해치셋을 조금 더 확장한 버전입니다. 기존 대비 페이지 테이블 덤프 기능도 일반화 시킨게 차이군요.\n[PATCH v1 1/2] mm/page_idle: Add support for per-pid page_idle using virtual indexing https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190722213205.140845-1-joel@joelfernandes.org\n리눅스 커널은 page_idle 이라는 인터페이스를 통해 특정 페이지의 액세스 여부를 파악할 수 있게 합니다. 저도 이걸 통해서 wss 를 재거나 하는데 쓸 수 있는 도구를 만들었었죠.\n문제는 이 인터페이스는 쓰기가 조금 복잡합니다.

Typically, this means no more than about 60 lines of code per function.\n최소 함수당 두개의 런타임 단정문을 사용하라.  평균적으로 함수당 최소 두개의 단정문이 있어야 한다. 단정문은 실제 수행 중에 일어나선 안되는 문제가 있는 조건을 검사하는데 사용되어야 한다. 단정문은 항상 사이드 이펙트로부터 자유로워야 하고 Boolean 테스트로 정의되어야 한다. 단정문이 실패한다면 명시적인 복구 동작이 행해져야 하는데, 예를 들면 이 실패한 단정문을 수행한 함수를 호출한 측에 에러 정보를 리턴하는 것이다. 정적 검사 도구가 절대 실패할 수 없거나 항상 성공한다고 증명해내는 단정문은 모두 이 규칙을 어기는 것이다. (예를 들어, 전혀 도움 되지 않을 assert(true) 문을 추가함으로써 이 규칙을 만족시킬 순 없다.)\nUse a minimum of two runtime assertions per function.  The assertion density of the code should average to a minimum of two assertions per function. Assertions are used to check for anomalous conditions that should never happen in real-life executions. Assertions must always be side-effect free and should be defined as Boolean tests. When an assertion fails, an explicit recovery action must be taken, e.g., by returning an error condition to the caller of the function that executes the failing assertion. Any assertion for which a static checking tool can prove that it can never fail or never hold violates this rule. (I.e., it is not possible to satisfy the rule by adding unhelpful \u0026ldquo;assert(true)\u0026rdquo; statements.)\n데이터의 사용 영역을 가능한 작게 잡아라.  데이터 객체는 가능한 가장 작은 단계의 영역에서 선언되어야만 한다.\nRestrict the scope of data to the smallest possible.  Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of scope.\n리턴 타입이 void 가 아닌 (non-void) 모든 함수의 리턴값은 검사되거나 리턴값이 무의미하다는 걸 알리기 위해 void 로 캐스팅 되어야 한다.  non-void 함수의 리턴값은 각 호출 함수에 의해 체크되어야 하며, 패러미터의 유효성은 각 함수 안에서 검사되어야 한다.\nCheck the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless.  The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each calling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside each function.\n전처리기를 아껴 사용하라.  전처리기의 사용은 헤더 파일을 포함하는 용도와 간단한 매그로 정의로 국한되어야만 한다. 토큰 붙이기, 유동적 갯수의 인자 리스트, 그리고 재귀적 매크로 호출은 허용되지 않는다. 모든 매크로는 완전한 구문적 단위로 확장되어야만 한다. 조건적 컴파일 지시어의 사용은 많은 경우 모호하지만, 항상 금지될 수는 없다. 이는 거대한 소프트웨어 개발 노력이 든다 하더라도 동일한 헤더 파일의 중복 포함을 방지하는 상용문 외의 한두개의 조건적 컴파일 지시어를 위한 정당화가 필요하다는 것을 의미한다. 그런 모든 경우에는 도구 기반의 검사를 통한 플래그가 붙어있거나 코드 안에 사용의 정당성에 대한 설명이 있어야 한다.\nUse the preprocessor sparingly.  The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of header files and simple macro definitions. Token pasting, variable argument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not allowed. All macros must expand into complete syntactic units. The use of conditional compilation directives is often also dubious, but cannot always be avoided. This means that there should rarely be justification for more than one or two conditional compilation directives even in large software development efforts, beyond the standard boilerplate that avoids multiple inclusion of the same header file. Each such use should be flagged by a tool-based checker and justified in the code.\n포인터의 사용을 한단계 디레퍼런스로 제한하고, 함수 포인터는 사용하지 말라.  포인터의 사용은 제한되어야 한다. 구체적으로, 두단계 이상의 디레퍼런스는 허용되지 않는다. 포인터 디레퍼런스 오퍼레이션이 매크로 정의나 typedef 선언 안에 숨겨져선 안된다. 함수 포인터는 허용되지 않는다.\nLimit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers.  The use of pointers should be restricted. Specifically, no more than one level of dereferencing is allowed. Pointer dereference operations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef declarations. Function pointers are not permitted.\n모든 가능한 경고를 활성화 한 채 컴파일 하라; 그리고 모든 경고는 해당 소프트웨어의 배포 전에 해결되어야 한다.  모든 코드는 개발을 시작한 첫날부터 모든 컴파일러 경고가 가장 엄중한 설정으로 활성화 된 채 컴파일 되어야만 한다. 모든 코드는 이 설정 아래 아무런 경고 없이 컴파일 되어야 한다. 모든 코드는 최소 하루에 한번, 그러나 가급적 한번 넘게, 최신의 정적 소스 코드 분석도구를 통해 검사되어야 하며 이 검사를 어떤 경고도 없이 통과해야만 한다.\nCompile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before release of the software.  All code must be compiled, from the first day of development, with allcompiler warnings enabled at the compiler’s most pedantic setting. All code must compile with these setting without any warnings. All code must be checked daily with at least one, but preferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer and should pass the analyses with zero warnings.\n","date":1563672176,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563672176,"objectID":"ef1fb04ec715a697d28cfbcf7572438d","permalink":"/post/nasa_coding_rules/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T10:22:56+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/nasa_coding_rules/","section":"post","summary":"우연히 발견한 글 을 통해 NASA 의 코딩 규칙 10가지 를 알게 되었습니다. 너무 깐깐한 규칙 아닌가 싶기도 하지만 ping 하나 날리는데 40분이 걸리고 물리적으로는 접근할 수 없는 화성에 로봇을 보내야 한다면 이런 규칙은 합리적이라 볼 수 있겠죠. 제가 참고한 저 글은 이걸 파이썬이나 자바스크립트와 같은 곳에서도 어떻게 적용해 볼 수 있을지를 고찰해 보고 있습니다. 이 포스트에선 단순히 이 10개의 규칙을 번역해 봅니다.\n goto 또는 재귀호출과 같은 복잡한 수행 흐름을 피하라.","tags":["coding","coding rule","coding style"],"title":"NASA's Power of 10 Coding Rules (Korean)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["talks"],"content":"[Linux Plumbers Conference 2019] (https://www.linuxplumbersconf.org/blog/2019/) 와 함께 열리는 올해의 [Linux Kernel Summit] (https://lwn.net/Articles/788378/) 에 제안한 발표 주제가 accept 되어 9월에 리스본에서 이에 대한 내용을 발표하게 되었습니다. 발표 제목은 \u0026ldquo;Tracing Data Access Pattern with Bounded Overhead and Best-effort Accuracy\u0026rdquo; 입니다.\n티켓이 너무 일찍 팔려버리는 바람에 올해는 들으러도 못가나 걱정했는데 갈 수 있게 됐네요, 다행입니다! :D\n My talk proposal to the Linux Kernel Summit of this year which is co-located with the Linux Plumbers has accepted!

Leetcode 는 왜 이제 알게 됐나 싶은 생각이 들 정도로 도움이 되었습니다.\n링크드인 및 이력서 지인들과의 대화 도중, 링크드인은 내가 지금 직업을 구하고 있는지 아닌지를 알리는 기능이 있다는 걸 우연히 알게 되었습니다. 이걸 켜니 몇몇 회사의 리크루터들이 연락을 줬습니다. 이 회사도 마찬가지였습니다. 채용하는 포지션에 대한 아주 짧막한 설명과 함께, 관심 있으면 이력서를 보내달라는 연락이 왔고, 이력서를 보내니 회사의 해당 포지션 채용 링크를 보내주며 시스템을 통해 지원해 달라고 했습니다.\n온라인 코딩 사흘만에 이 회사에서 구축한 코딩 테스트 시스템으로의 초대장이 왔습니다. Leetcode 와 같은 여타 코딩 테스트 사이트랑 비슷하게 되어 있는데, 네개 정도의 문제가 있습니다. 편한 시간을 골라서 문제를 풀 수 있으며, 테스트를 시작하면 중단은 못하고 두시간 내에 테스트를 반드시 끝내야 합니다. 실제 인터뷰어와 전화를 통해 진행하는게 아니다보니 내가 편한 시간을 고를 수 있고, 영어 듣기가 부족한 저로썬 문제가 글로 써져 있어 좋더군요. 제출하고 나면 곧바로 풀이에 대한 전체 테스트 결과도 볼 수 있었습니다.\n아주 어려운 문제는 없었고 간단한 자료구조와 알고리즘 위주였기에 무난하게 문제를 풀 수 있었습니다. 하지만 마지막 한문제는 일부 corner case 를 제대로 풀지 못해 점수가 만족스럽지는 않았습니다.\n전화 인터뷰 몇일 후, 전화 인터뷰 하고 싶으니 일정을 잡자는 메일이 왔습니다. 적당히 일정을 잡고 인터뷰를 진행했습니다.\n애초에 외국 회사는 온사이트 인터뷰까지 진행되면 후보에게 비행기표 등을 지불해야 되니 이 단계에서 가급적 많은 후보자를 탈락시킨다고 합니다. 전화 통화는 바디랭귀지가 일체 허용되지 않거니와 통화품질, 인터뷰어의 독특한 억양 등의 문제가 있을 수 있기에 저처럼 영어가 약한 사람에게는 정말 죽을 맛입니다. 다행히도 이번 인터뷰는 통화품질도 좋았고 인터뷰어의 발음도 제 귀에 또렷하게 들리는 억양이라 큰 문제는 없었습니다. 그래도 역시 기본 실력이 어디가진 않아서, 몇번은 못알아듣고 버벅이긴 했습니다.\n인터뷰는 약 한시간 정도 분량으로, 제가 채용되면 함께 일하게 될 팀과 업무, 그리고 인터뷰어 자신에 대한 간단한 소개를 시작으로, 제 소개와 그에 대한 문답, 업무적 경험에 대한 질문, 기술적 질문으로 이어졌고, 막판에 약 5분 정도 제가 회사에 대해 질문할 수 있는 시간으로 구성되었습니다.\n소개 후의 문답은 제가 소개한 제 연구들에 대해 깊은 질문이 왔는데, 평소 하는 일이라 쉽게 대답할 수 있었습니다.\n업무적 경험에 대한 문답에서는 어떤 특정 상황에 처했던 경험을 이야기 해달라고 하는데, 이게 꽤 어려웠습니다. 질문받은 경우에 처한 경험이야 많지만 그 중 어떤 걸 골라서 이야기해야 좋은 인상을 얻을까 고민하게 되거든요. 팀원의 반대 의견에 부딪혔을 때에 대한 경험도 요청받았는데, 재밌게도 그날 아침에 함께 연구를 진행하고 있는 친구와 격렬하게 토론했던 즐거운 경험이 있어 그걸 이야기 했습니다. 다른 질문들에는 오픈소스 활동과 개인 프로젝트에 대한 경험도 이야기 했습니다.\n기술적 질문은 커널의 동작 구조 및 원리에 대한 몇가지 질문이 있었습니다. 역시 밥먹고 하는 일이다 보니 어렵지 않게 답할 수 있었습니다.\n마지막 질답 시간엔 무슨 질문했는지 기억이 잘 안나는데, 내가 이 면접 통과하고 함께 일하게 되면 어떤 일을 하게 될지, 내가 소개한 연구들 중 어떤 내용이 회사에 도움 될 수 있을거라 생각하는지 뭐 그런 질문을 한 것 같습니다.\n전화 중에도 코딩 테스트가 있을 줄 알았는데, 없었습니다. 다행이었죠.\n온사이트 인터뷰 제의 다시 몇일 후, 2차 전화 인터뷰가 있겠거니 하고 있었는데, 온사이트 인터뷰를 보자는 메일이 왔습니다! 예전에 모 회사와는 대략 네다섯번까지 이어지는 전화 인터뷰를 하면서 파김치가 되었던 기억이 있는데, 이번엔 한번의 전화 인터뷰만에 스크리닝이 끝나서 정말 기뻤습니다. 메일은 온사이트 인터뷰 가능한 일정 (3주의 기한을 줬습니다), 일하게 된다면 언제부터 일할 수 있는지, 원하는 연봉은 얼마인지, 인터뷰 보러 오는데 비자 필요한지 등을 물어왔습니다.\n적당적당히 일정이 잡혔고, 회사에서 비행기표와 호텔을 예약해 줬습니다. 호텔은 이틀을 예약해 줬습니다. 앞에서 이야기했듯 사실 이때까지만 해도 전 이 회사에 붙을 거라는 생각은 없었습니다. 회사가 면접 통과하기 어렵기로 유명한 회사이기도 하고 준비가 부족하다고 생각했으니까요. 이 시점까지만 해도 그저 공짜로 외국여행 하는구나 싶었죠.\n온사이트 인터뷰 온사이트 인터뷰는 채용되면 실제 제가 일하게 될 오피스에서 아침 10시부터 오후 4시까지 6시간동안 이루어졌습니다. 한시간마다 한명씩 다른 인터뷰어가 들어왔는데, 중간에 한번은 두 인터뷰어가 함께 들어왔습니다. 따라서 총 여섯번의 인터뷰를 본 셈이며, 매 인터뷰마다 형식은 전화 인터뷰와 비슷했습니다. 인터뷰어의 회사와 자기 자신에 대한 소개, 제 소개와 그에 대한 문답, 업무적 경험 질문, 기술적 질문, 마지막으로 제가 질문하는 시간.\n붙을리가 있냐, 여행이나 하자 하는 생각으로 왔지만 막상 당일이 되자 굉장히 긴장되더군요. 그런데 이날 만난 직원들은 너무나도 친절하고 유쾌했습니다. 막상 면접이 시작되니 면접을 본다기보다는 기술 커뮤니티 밋업에서 만난 사람들이랑 즐거운 기술 이야기 하는 느낌이라 너무 즐거웠습니다.\n오후 12시부터 한시간은 점심시간이라 인터뷰어 한명과 함께 식사했습니다. 식사가 인터뷰의 연장인 셈이죠. 앞서 이야기한대로 어찌나 긴장이 풀렸는지 이 때 인터뷰어 앞에서 맥주까지 한잔 했습니다.\n그 중 두번의 인터뷰는 화이트보드를 사용한 코딩 인터뷰가 포함되었습니다. 그 와중에 가장 긴장한 시간이었긴 한데, 역시 즐겁게 진행되었습니다. 다행히 평범한 자료구조 문제였기에 조금 버벅이긴 했지만 일단 코딩을 하는건 어렵지 않았으며, 이후 관련한 질문에 답하고 개선을 어떻게 할 수 있을지 논의하고 추가 코딩을 했는데 이 과정 역시 즐거웠습니다.\n인터뷰가 끝나고 나선 붙든 떨어지든 상관 없지만 평생 잊지 못할 만큼 즐거운 시간이었고 이런 시간을 앞으로도 갖고 싶다, 떨어져도 여한이 없다는 생각이 들었습니다. 면접을 본게 아니라 커뮤니티 모임 같은데 가서 놀다 온 느낌이었죠.\n오퍼 온사이트 인터뷰가 금요일이었습니다. 현지 시간으로 화요일, 인터뷰에 통과했으니 정식 오퍼를 보내겠다는 연락을 받았습니다.\n정리 준비부터 오퍼를 받기까지의 제 경험을 정리해 봤습니다. 준비도 능력도 부족한데 어디까지나 운이 좋아서 면접을 통과한지라 다른 분들께 이 기록이 얼마나 도움이 될지 모르겠습니다. 그래도 공유하지 않는 것보다는 낫겠죠. 누군가에겐 이 기록이 도움이 되길 빌어봅니다.\n","date":1560762965,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1560762965,"objectID":"8f29f0392ab5595f5184bbea35cb29c3","permalink":"/post/my_job_interview/","publishdate":"2019-06-17T18:16:05+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/my_job_interview/","section":"post","summary":"이번 여름 졸업을 앞두고 구직 활동을 한 결과, 얼마전 운좋게도 미국에 본사를 두고 있는 한 글로벌 IT 기업의 커널/하이퍼바이저 팀으로부터 잡 오퍼를 받았습니다. 취업을 향한 한걸음 한걸음이 어둠 속을 더듬더듬, 때로는 막무가내로 헤쳐나가는 느낌이었는데, 이런 저의 경험을 공유하는게 어떤 분들께는 도움이 되지 않을까 싶어 공유해 봅니다.\n목표설정 취업을 할까 포닥을 할까 모호한 고민만 하다가 어느새 4월 중순이 되어서야 해외 IT 회사로 직장을 구하겠다는 목표가 설정되었습니다. 그제서야 든 생각은 너무 늦었다, 준비가 부족하다, 하는 것이었습니다.","tags":["record","job interview","coding interview"],"title":"My Job Interview Record (2019 summer)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["lkml news"],"content":"[PATCH v3 0/5] THP aware uprobe https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190612220320.2223898-1-songliubraving@fb.com\nuprobe 는 THP 로 되어있는 페이지를 쪼갭니다. 이로 인해 성능 향상 효과가 사라지죠. 이 패치셋은 uprobe 가 THP 를 인식하게 해서 이런 문제를 제거합니다.\n[PATCH v2 0/5] Introduce MADV_COLD and MADV_PAGEOUT https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20190610111252.239156-1-minchan@kernel.org\n기존에도 소개한 MADV_COLD 와 MADV_PAGEOUT 을 madvise() 에 추가하는 패치셋의 두번째 버전입니다. 이 패치셋을 ChromeOS 팀의 Brian Geffon 은 가져다가 탭이 백그라운드로 들어가고 45초 이상 그 상태를 유지하면 이 기능을 사용해서 페이지를 proactively swap out 시켰는데, 그 결과 tab 전환 속도가 25% 나 빨라졌다고 합니다.\n[v3 RFC PATCH 0/9] Migrate mode for node reclaim with heterogeneous memory hierarchy https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1560468577-101178-1-git-send-email-yang.shi@linux.alibaba.com\nNUMA node 로 pmem 을 취급할 수 있게 된 이후, 노드간 migration 을 보다 효율적으로 하기 위한 패치셋의 세번째 버전입니다.

Meanwhile, storage devices have evolved so that their speed is comparable to the speed of DRAM while their capacity scales are comparable to that of hard disk drives (HDD). Thus, hierarchial memory systems configuring DRAM as the main memory and high-end storages as swap devices will be common.\nDue to the unique characteristics of these modern storage devices, the swap target decision should be optimal. It is essential to know the exact data access patterns of workloads for such an optimal decision, although underlying systems cannot accurately estimate such complex and dynamic patterns. For this reason, memory systems allow programs to voluntarily hint their data access pattern. Nevertheless, it is exhausting for a human to manually figure out the patterns and embed optimal hints if the workloads are huge and complex.\nThis project introduces a compiler extension that automatically optimizes a program to voluntarily hint its dynamic data access patterns to the underlying swap system using a static/dynamic analysis based profiling result. To our best knowledge, this is the first profile-guided optimization (PGO) for modern swap devices. Our empirical evaluation of the scheme using realistic workloads shows consistent improvement in performance and swap device lifetime up to 2.65 times and 2.98 times, respectively.\nPublications And Presentations  SeongJae Park, Yunjae Lee, Moonsub Kim Heon Y.

From the writing of this post, it had some changes, so below content, especially the test setup and running will not work. Recommend you to refer to the official document in the kernel for detailed tutorial. It also has a python version dependency now, so you would encounter a problem with Ubuntu 16.04. Recommend you to use later Python or Ubuntu 18.04 instead.\nI have attended FAST'19 last February. There was Ted Tso. I saw he hanging out with a few of Redhat people who I met during the lunch and tagged along with them. During the chat, we talked about test and Ted introduced us a testing framework called KUnit. I started using it after return from FAST'19 and felt it is amazing, so I would like to introduce it in this post.\nAs its name intimates, KUnit is a unit test framework for the Linux kernel. Google\u0026rsquo;s Brendan Higgins is developing it and he is also sending RFC patches to LKML so that it can be merged into the mainline. Because he is a Googler, he is hosting a source tree on a Google server and also made a well written Documentation.\nThis post will further briefly summarise how you can use KUnit. I tested this post on my Ubuntu 16.04 server.\nInstall You can receive Kunit development kernel from https://kunit.googlesource.com. Clone it with below simple command. I will use 5.0-rc5 based version which Brendan has recently sent the RFC patches.\n$ git clone -b kunit/rfc/5.0-rc5/v4 https://kunit.googlesource.com/linux Of course, you can get only patches via Patchwork and apply it on your kernel. I got it and applied it on my v5.0 kernel and it worked well.\nNow you should install some packages for KUnit. You need only the packages that required by kernel build. For the list of the packages, refer to the post describing it.\nTest It\u0026rsquo;s almost ready. Let\u0026rsquo;s run the example tests that kunit provides.\nFirst, you should write a file named kunitconfig under the kernel tree root directory. This file specifies what tests you want to run. Just write as below for now:\n$ cd linux $ echo CONFIG_KUNIT=y \u0026gt; kunitconfig $ echo CONFIG_KUNIT_TEST=y \u0026gt;\u0026gt; kunitconfig $ echo CONFIG_KUNIT_EXAMPLE_TEST=y \u0026gt;\u0026gt; kunitconfig Now you can run the KUnit example tests as below:\n$ ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py You will see results below on your terminal:\n[11:31:47] Building KUnit Kernel ...

It says example tests including kunit-resource-test, kunit-try-catch-test, string-stream-tets, example has ran, and all of those passed.\nKUnit should also build the kernel for the test, and the build takes a few of time. In this case, it took 26 seconds. That said, this was long because it\u0026rsquo;s first build. It took about only 10 seconds for me when I modified only one file after. Also, it takes very short time only for running actual test. In this case, it took only 0.27 seconds! Therefore, it will not take too huge time even though you have lots of tests.\nRefer to the Kunit official document to know how you can add your unit test. Not so hard :)\nConclusion Introduced the unit test framework for the Linux kernel, KUnit. I am also using it for my recent programming and could feel the advantage of TDD again.

This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly. To generate this message, Docker took the following steps: 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon. 2. The Docker daemon pulled the \u0026quot;hello-world\u0026quot; image from the Docker Hub. (amd64) 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the executable that produces the output you are currently reading. 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it to your terminal.

워크로드 (이벤트)를 정의하고 그런 이벤트의 발생을 줄이는 내용을 담고 있습니다.\n최적화 방법은 다음과 같습니다. 먼저, lower id free list 가 사용 가능하면 high order free list 를 쪼개기보다 그걸 먼저 사용합니다. 메모리 분절화 이벤트가 발생하면 임시적으로 워터마크를 높입니다. kswapd 가 일어나서 적은양의 오래된 메모리를 리클레임하고, 이어서 kcompactd 가 일어나서 시스템 메모리 연속성을 복구시킵니다. 물론 이는 오버헤드를 추가합니다. 마지막으로, kswapd 가 진전을 일으킬 수 있도록 일부 movable 페이지 할당을 기다리게 합니다. 이 기다리는 시간 역시 오버헤드와 연관되므로 적절히 맞춰질 필요가 있겠죠.\n이 패치셋을 적용한 결과 94% 이상 메모리

Termux 등을 사용하면 셸도 원활하게 사용할 수 있습니다. 업스트림 리눅스 커널을 직접 빌드해 설치하려면 까다롭긴 하지만 불가능한 것도 아니긴 합니다.\n한가지 치명적인 건 운영체제 업데이트가 원활치 않아 보이는군요. 가격을 생각해야 하니 나온지 오래된 모델들을 알아봤는데 하나같이 운영체제 업데이트가 되지 않고 있는 듯 했습니다.\n크롬북 그렇게 이번에도 아이쇼핑만 하고 그만두려던 차에 크롬북이 눈에 들어왔습니다. 크롬북은 안드로이드보다 훨씬 개방적인 정책을 취한 오픈소스 운영체제인 크롬 OS 를 사용하고 있습니다. 리눅스 커널 기반이고, 최근들어 안드로이드 앱과 리눅스 네이티브 앱을 공식 지원하고 있습니다. 구글 정책상 대부분의 크롬 OS 디바이스가 최신 OS로 업데이트 됩니다. 과거에 잠시 셋업만 해봤는데 crouton 등을 사용하면 Ubuntu 등의 리눅스 배포판을 설치할 수 있고 Chrome OS 와의 전환도 키 하나만 누르면 되어서 매우 간편했던 기억이 있습니다. 문제라면 폼팩터가 랩톱의 폼팩터라는 것인데, 요즘 나오는 크롬북은 디스플레이를 360도 전환할 수 있어 태블릿 모드와 텐트 모드를 사용할 수 있는 제품이 대부분입니다. 가격도 매우 저렵한게 특징입니다.\n이거다 싶었습니다!\n크롬북 플러스 그렇게 크롬북 모델들을 찾아보니 삼성 크롬북 플러스[1] 가 눈에 들어왔습니다. 12.3인치 화면에 2400x1600 해상도. 책 읽기에 딱 적절해 보입니다. 스타일러스 펜도 있고, 6코어 프로세서는 ARM 프로세서지만 제게는 차고 넘쳐 보이더군요. 한가지 걸리는건 브랜드와 가격. 삼성에 대해 안좋은 인식이 있습니다. 그리고 가격이 약 450 달러. 한국에서 사려면 대략 50만원을 넘습니다. 40만원 미만을 원하던 걸 생각하면 가격이 조금 셉니다.\n최종 구입 혹시나 하고 아마존에서 크롬북 프로 검색을 해봤습니다. 중고 모델은 350불 정도 하는군요. 어차피 보조 디바이스라 중고인건 괜찮은데 가격이 여전히 좀 그렇군요. 망설이며 며칠을 보내다가 새로고침을 해보니 가격이 250불이 되어 있었습니다. 아마존은 이런식으로 핫딜이 있다고 하는군요. 이때가 아니면 언제 지르랴, 하고 질렀습니다.\n[1] https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/xe513c24-k01us-xe513c24-k01us/\n","date":1535950320,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535950320,"objectID":"ce902f6243a0c279f48fbe5c8072ab4e","permalink":"/post/chromebook-plus-purchase/","publishdate":"2018-09-03T13:52:00+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/chromebook-plus-purchase/","section":"post","summary":"크롬북을 구매했습니다. 구매 결정 과정부터 사용기까지 내용을 정리해볼까 합니다. 이번 글에서는 크롬북을 구매하기까지의 고민과 과정을 정리합니다.\n기본적으로 저는 글을 읽는걸 좋아하기도 하고 읽어야만 하기도 합니다. 그러다보니 여행을 가더라도 항상 어떤 책을 들고갈까 고르는게 설레기도 하지만 짜증나기도 하고, 마음만 앞서서 캐리어 무게를 책으로 꽉 채우기도 합니다. 그래서 예전부터 이북을 고려해 봤지만 너무 반응속도가 느리기도 하고 인쇄된 것에 비해선 가독성도 떨어지고 그 특유의 책을 넘겨가며 보는 반응은 아닌 것 같아 구매하지 않고 있었습니다.","tags":["chromebook","chrome os","chromebook plus"],"title":"Chromebook Plus Purchase (크롬북 플러스 구매 결정기)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["lkml news"],"content":"Linux 4.19-rc2 https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CA+55aFyG0GbDfoghEhAmKBPcZCiPu6CCpPRz9GwjCzLuP_Vv5Q@mail.gmail.com\n리눅스 4.19 두번째 릴리즈 후보 버전의 릴리즈입니다. 첫번째 릴리즈 후보 버전 릴리즈 후엔 사람들이 좀 쉬게 마련이고 버그를 찾기엔 시간이 많지 않았기에 큰 변화는 없었습니다. 유럽사람들의 경우 아직 휴가기간인 사람도 많구요. 미국 OSSummit 이 지난주 진행된 것도 한 영향이겠네요.\n[PATCH -V5 00/21] swap: Swapout/swapin THP in one piece https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180903072214.24602-1-ying.huang@intel.com\n관심있게 지켜보고 있는, THP swapout/in 패치입니다. 다음 머지 윈도우에선 들어갈 수 있을까요?\nPlumbers 2018 - Performance and Scalability Microconference https://lkml.kernel.org/r/1dc80ff6-f53f-ae89-be29-3408bf7d69cc@oracle.com\n올해 Linux Plumbers Conference 에 \u0026lsquo;Performance and Scalability Microconference\u0026rsquo; 가 열립니다.

Torvalds의 작업 이력을 알아낼 수 있는 유일한 방법은 전체 릴리즈 버전 사이의 거대한 diff 를 통하는 것 뿐이었습니다.\n이는 오픈소스 리비전 컨트롤 시스템이 없기 때문은 아니었습니다. 1980년대부터 CVS 가 있었고, 그 당시에도 가장 유명한 시스템이었습니다. 그 핵심 기능을 사용해서 기여자들이 패치를 중앙 저장소에 보낼 수 있었고 그 저장소로 들어가는 패치의 기록을 조사할 수 있었습니다.\n하지만 CVS 에 대한 많은 불만이 있었습니다. 그 중 하나는 변경 사항을 파일별로 제공하고 커다란 패치는 하나의 버전으로 인식할 수 없어서, 다른 개발자들로부터의 과거의 기여를 해석하기가 어려웠습니다. 또한, 두개의 같은 파일을 수정하는 패치가 동시에 보내졌을 때 발생하는 레이스 컨디션 같은 고치기 어려운 버그들도 일부 있었습니다.\nLinus는 CVS 를 좋아하지 않았는데, 부분적으로는 다른 사람들의 불만과 같은 이유 때문이었고 부분적으로는 후에야 명확해진 그만의 이유 때문이었습니다. 그는 CVS 의 버그와 이상한 기능들을 해결하려는 목표를 가지고 2000년대 초부터 발전되어온 오픈소스 프로젝트인 SVN 도 좋아하지 않았습니다.\n많은 리눅스 커널 개발자들이 적당한 리비전 컨트롤의 부재에 불만족스러 했으며, 따라서 Linus가 사용 가능한 리비전 컨트롤 중에서 뭐든 하나를 고르길 바라는 커뮤니티로부터의 압력이 항상 있었습니다. 그리고, 2002년, Linus는 그렇게 했습니다. 충격적이고 당황스럽게도, Linus는 Larry McVoy 에 의해 운영되는 BitMover 라는 회사에 의해 개발된, 소스코드가 공개되어있지 않은 상업용 시스템인 BitKeeper 를 선택했습니다.\n리눅스 커널은 역사상 가장 중요한 오픈소스 프로젝트였고, Linus 그 스스로가 수십년간 다른 오픈소스 프로젝트들이 따라하게 되었고 지금까지도 그렇게 하고 있는 오픈소스 개발 방법을 처음으로 발견한 사람이었습니다. Linus가 무슨 생각을 하는 거지? 어떻게 그가 그의 커뮤니티와 오픈소스 세계를 이렇게 배신할수가 있지? 이게 Linus가 처음 커널 개발에 BitKeeper 를 사용했을 때 대부분의 반응이었습니다.\n또한, BitMover 는 돈을 받지 않고 BitKeeper 를 사용할 수 있는 라이센스를 제공하는데 대한 대가로 리눅스 커뮤니티에 제한을 걸었습니다. 첫째, 리눅스 개발자들은 BitKeeper 를 사용하는 동안 다른 경쟁 리비전 컨트롤 시스템 개발 프로젝트에 참여할 수 없었습니다. 둘째, BitMover 는 라이센스에 대한 악용을 막기 위해 커널 프로젝트에 관계된 일부 메타데이터를 제어할 수 있었습니다. 이 메타데이터에 대한 접근이 불가능하면, 커널 개발자들은 다른 리비전 컨트롤 시스템에서의 중요한 표준적 기능인, 과거의 커널 버전들 사이의 비교를 할 수 없었습니다.\nLinus가 BitKeeper 를 사용한지 수년이 지나도 논쟁은 줄어들지 않았습니다. 그의 기본적 주장은, 그는 프리 소프트웨어 (Free Software) 광신도가 아니라는 것이었습니다. 그는 오픈소스 도구들이 같은 일을 하는 상업용 도구들에 비해 낫다면 그걸 사용할 거라고 했습니다. 하지만 상업용 도구가 더 낫다면, 그는 다른 도구를 고려하지 않을 거라고요.\n하지만, 많은 커널 개발자들이 실제로 프리 소프트웨어 광신도였습니다. 커뮤니티에 손상을 입히고 리눅스 커널 프로젝트의 fork 를 일으킬 만큼은 아니지만 Linus와 다른 개발자들간의 분노와 긴장이 심해졌습니다. Alan Cox, Al Viro, David Miller, Andrea Arcangeli, Andrew Morton 과 많은 수의 다른 사람들이 경쟁 프로젝트를 이끌만한 기술력을 가지고 있음이 분명했고, 심지어 일부는 상당수 커널 개발자들을 그들 쪽으로 끌어갈 명성을 가지고 있었습니다. 하지만 아무도 그러지 않았습니다. 이 긴장과 적대는 계속 유지되었습니다.\nBitKeeper 의 무엇이 그리 대단했을까요? BitKeeper 에서 자랑한 건 분산시스템을 제공한다는 것으로, 모든 저장소가 쉽게 fork 되고 merge 될 수 있었습니다. 이게 핵심이었습니다. 이를 통해, 특정 하위 그룹의 커널 개발자들은 리비전 컨트롤의 이득을 얻으면서 그룹끼리 독자적으로 협업하고, 준비된 다음에 그들의 변경 사항을 Linus에게 전달할 수 있었습니다. 이를 통해, 전에는 Linus 한명의 어깨에 완전히 매여있던 수많은 작업이 Linus가 믿는 개발자들, 또는 그렇게 작업하기로 한 그룹들에게 분산될 수 있었습니다. 아키텍쳐별 코드, 드라이버, 그리고 커널의 하위 시스템들이 모두 어떻게든 독립적으로 개발되고, 이후 적절한 시점에 한번에 메인 커널에 병합될 수 있었습니다.\n슬슬 하는 이야기가 익숙하게 들릴 겁니다만, 2002년에 이건 새로운 아이디어였습니다. CVS 와 Subversion 같은 당시 존재하던 프로젝트들에서 fork 와 merge 는 주인만 할 수 있고, 죽고 싶도록 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업이었습니다. BitKeeper 를 통해, 이게 사소한 작업이 되었습니다.\n커널 개발 도구의 핵심부에 독점 소프트웨어를 사용하려는 Linus의 의지는 많은 사람들이 대안을 만드는데 더욱 노력하게 만들었습니다. CVS 와 Subversion 프로젝트는 너무 많은 기초적 설계 오류가 있었고, 이미 너무 많이 개발이 진행되어 변경하기가 쉽지 않았습니다. 다른 프로젝트들 모두 마찬가지였습니다. 하지만 이제 그들은 Linus가 정말 원하는걸 알거나 안다고 생각했으므로, 정말로 코딩을 시작할 수 있었습니다. 그 결과 분산 개발 기능을 제공하는 많은 수의 리비전 컨트롤 시스템이 나왔습니다.\n그런 시스템들 중에 arch, darcs, 그리고 monotone 등이 있었습니다. 그들은 Bitkeeper 를 경쟁 상대라고 함으로써, Linus가 Bitkeeper 에 대한 대안으로 그들을 선택하라고 설득했습니다.\n많은 사람들이 시도했지만, 아무도 성공하지 못했습니다. 이는 부분적으로는 Linus가 CVS 와 Subversion 에 뭐가 빠져있는지 모두 이야기 하지 않았듯, 그 프로젝트들에 Linus가 더 필요로 하는 것이 무엇인지 모두 말하지 않았기 때문입니다. 그리고, Linus가 소스가 폐쇄된 도구를 사용하는것도 개의치 않는 것 같았으므로, 어떤 대안이 그에게 받아들여질만 하려면 그 대안은 BitKeeper 보다 훨씬 기술적으로 향상되어 있어야만 할 것이었습니다. 따라서, BitKeeper 전에도 오픈소스 툴의 기능은 충분하지 않았지만, BitKeeper 가 나타남으로써 오픈소스 툴이 맞춰야 할 기능의 목표가 더욱 높아진 셈입니다.\n수년간의 많은 노력 후에도, 어떤 오픈소스 대안도 Linus의 필요를 맞추기엔 CVS 나 Subversion 보다도 크게 나아지지 못했습니다. 만약 Samba 를 만들었고 rsync 의 공동 창시자인 Andrew Tridgell 이 아니었더라면 이 상황은 훨씬 오래 지속될 수 있었을 겁니다. 2005년, Andrew는 프리 소프트웨어인 대안을 만들기 위해 BitKeeper 네트워킹 프로토콜을 리버스 엔지니어링 하려 했습니다. 그가 아니었더라도, 누군가는 시도했을 겁니다 - 그건 그저 시간 문제였습니다. Larry McVoy 는 누구든 이 시도를 했다면 당장 지원을 끊겠다고 리눅스 개발자들에게 경고했고, 실제로 그렇게 했습니다. 결국, 급작스럽게 BitKeeper 를 커널 개발에 사용될 수 없게 되었습니다. 전체 개발 도구와 분산 버전 컨트롤로부터 생겨난 개발 문화는 앞날을 알 수 없는 상황에 놓였습니다.\n이게 무슨 의미일까요? Linus는 그의 과거 방식의 개발로 돌아가서 모든 패치를 그 자신에게 보내라고 했을까요? 그렇지 않다면, BitKeeper 의 오픈소스 대안들 가운데 하나를 선택했을까요? 만약 그가 그랬다면, 어떤 대안을 골랐을까요?\n이 시점에서, 놀라운 일이 발생했습니다. Linus가 리눅스 커널 개발을 1991년 시작한 후 처음으로 작업을 완전히 멈췄습니다. 현존하는 어떤 도구도 그가 원하는 일을 해주지 못했으므로, 그는 자신의 것을 만들기로 결정했습니다.\nLinus의 주요 관심은, 사실 속도였습니다. 이것이 그가 기존에는 완전히, 적어도 현존하는 프로젝트들이 이해할 수 있는 방식으로는 이야기하지 않은 부분이었습니다. 전세계에서 전력을 다해 패치를 보내오는 수천명의 커널 개발자들을 위해, 그는 기존에는 상상할 수 없는 속도로 동작하는 무언가가 필요했습니다. 그는 가장 거대하고 가장 복잡한 작업이라 해도 완료하는데 몇초 이상 기다리는 걸 참을 수 없었습니다. Arch 도, darcs, monotone 도, 그리고 어떤 다른 프로젝트도 이 요구사항을 맞추지 못했습니다.\nLinus는 잠시 은둔한 채 코딩을 했고, 그 후에 그의 새로운 계획을 세상에 알렸습니다. 2005년 6월에 그 프로젝트를 시작한 이래 몇일만에, Linus의 git 리비전 컨트롤 시스템은 git 소스코드의 리비전 컨트롤을 완전히 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 몇주 후, git 은 리눅스 커널 개발의 리비전 컨트롤을 맡을 준비가 되었습니다. 몇달 후, 완전한 기능을 갖추었습니다. 이 시점에서, Linus는 이 프로젝트의 관리 권한을 해당 프로젝트의 가장 열정적인 기여자, Junio C. Hamano 에게 넘기고 리눅스 개발에 다시 전념했습니다.\n이 도구에 놀란 프리 소프트웨어 개발자 커뮤니티는 이 괴상한 작업물을 이해하려 노력했습니다. 이것은 리비전 컨트롤 소프트웨어의 어떤 것도 닮지 않았습니다. 사실, 이것은 리비전 컨트롤 시스템보다는 낮은 단계의 파일시스템 오퍼레이션들의 집합에 가까워 보였습니다. 그리고 다른 시스템들이 패치를 저장하는 것과 달리, 이것은 각각의 변경된 파일의 버전을 모두 저장했습니다. 어떻게 이런 방식이 괜찮을 수 있을까요? 하지만, 이 도구는 fork 와 merge 를 번개같은 속도로 처리할 수 있고, 패치를 요청하자마자 만들어낼 수 있었습니다.\n점진적으로, Junio는 CVS 와 Subversion 의 것들을 닮은 높은 수준의 커맨드 집합을 만들었습니다. Git 의 원래 커맨드들이 \u0026ldquo;배관\u0026rdquo; 이었다면, 새로운 커맨드들은 \u0026ldquo;도자기 제품\u0026rdquo; 이었습니다. 그리고, 결국 사용되게 되었습니다.\nBitKeeper 에 대한 논쟁과 분노가 있었던 만큼이나, git 의 계속된 개발을 향한 열망과 참여 의지가 많았습니다. 포팅, 확장 기능, 그리고 웹사이트들이 모든 것을 현재 상태로 끌어올렸습니다. 몇년만에, 거의 모든 사람들이 git 을 사용하게 되었습니다. 리눅스처럼, git 이 세상을 집어삼켰습니다.\n","date":1535544913,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1535544913,"objectID":"5186b5c3323752b2ed5092931d5fb9ab","permalink":"/post/git_origin_story_ko/","publishdate":"2018-08-29T21:15:13+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/git_origin_story_ko/","section":"post","summary":"최근

커널의 개발은 커뮤니티 주도입니다. 개발의 한 부분인 테스트 역시 커뮤니티 주도적입니다. 여러 개인 또는 단체가 커널을 각자의 방식으로 테스트 하고 그 결과를 공유합니다. 인텔에서는 0-day 서비스[1] 라는 서비스를 자체적으로 돌리는데, 이 서비스는 최신 리눅스 커널을 가져다가 빌드하고 다양한 기능 / 성능 테스트를 돌리고 그 결과 발견된 regression 을 LKML 에 메일로 보내주는 일을 합니다. 말하자면 Continuous Integration (CI) 이죠.\nLinux Kernel Performance (LKP) Tests[2] 는 0-day 서비스에서 기능 / 성능 테스트를 수행하는데 사용되는 도구입니다. 다양한 테스트를 돌리기 위한 시스템 환경 구성, 테스트 프로그램과 그 종속 프로그램 / 라이브러리의 설치와 환경 구성, 테스트 수행과 결과 정리, 그리고 테스트 진행 사이의 시스템 상태 프로파일링 및 프로파일링 결과 정리를 대신해 줍니다. 0-day 서비스에 연결되어 있지만 lkp-tests 와 0-day 서비스 사이의 종속성이 없으며, 오픈소스 프로젝트로 개발이 진행되고 있어 그 소스코드를 누구나 사용할 수 있으며 개인이 사용하기에도 편리하게 되어 있어서 개인 개발자가 자신의 패치를 테스트할 목적으로 사용하기에도 좋습니다. 이 글에서는 이러한 lkp-tests 의 구조와 사용법을 간단히 설명합니다. 전체적으로 인텔의 관련 블로그 글[3] 을 참고했습니다.\n설치 먼저 다음 커맨드로 lkp-tests 소스코드를 얻어옵니다:\n$ git clone https://github.com/intel/lkp-tests $ cd lkp-tests 그리고 lkp-tests 자체를 설치.\n$ sudo make install 이 커맨드는 단순히 지금 소스코드를 땡겨온 lkp-tests 소스코드 디렉토리의 bin/lkp 파일을 링크하는 /usr/local/bin/lkp 심볼릭 링크를 만들 뿐입니다. 따라서 셸에서 lkp 커맨드를 쓸 수 있게 해주죠. 이 lkp 파일이 결국 lkp-tests 의 대부분의 일을 해주는 핵심 커맨드입니다. 이 프로그램의 간단한 사용법은 다음과 같이 확인할 수 있습니다:\n$ lkp Usage: lkp \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; [options] INSTALLATION install JOB install binary dependencies for JOB JOB split JOB split JOB matrix compile JOB compile JOB into shell script TESTING run JOB run test JOB locally qemu JOB run test JOB in QEMU virtual machine RESULT result|rt|_rt|__rt PATTERNs show result dirs ls|ll PATTERNs ls result dirs rm-path result remove result dirs _rm PATTERNs remove _result dirs stat [options] show result stats compare [options] compare result stats DEBUG irb run irb with lib/*.rb loaded pry run pry with lib/*.rb loaded More commands can be found in /home/sjpark/lkp-tests/{bin,sbin,tools}/ 여기서 \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; 는 lkp-tests 소스코드 디렉토리 아래 bin/, sbin/, tools/, 또는 lkp-exec/ 아래 위치한 실행파일로, lkp 는 단순히 그 실행파일을 수행하면서 인자를 넘길 뿐입니다.\n테스트에 필요한 소프트웨어 설치 다음 커맨드는 lkp-tests 가 의존하고 있는 기본적 소프트웨어 패키지들을 모두 설치합니다:\n$ sudo lkp install Ubuntu 16.04 에서는 다음 패키지들을 까는군요:\nbc gawk gzip kmod time automake bison bsdtar build-essential bzip2 ca-certificates cpio fakeroot flex gcc git libc6-dev libc6-dev:i386 libklibc-dev libtool linux-libc-dev linux-libc-dev:i386 linux-tools-generic make openssl patch rsync ruby ruby-dev wget lkp-tests 내부 벤치마크 실행 이제 lkp-tests 에서 지원하는 벤치마크를 실제로 돌려봅시다.\n테스트 수행에 필요한 환경 설정 실제 테스트를 돌리기 위해선 벤치마크를 깔고, 그 벤치마크가 사용하는 패키지를 깔고, 테스트에 사용될 도구들을 깔고, 여러 설정을 하는등의 작업이 필요합니다.\n다음 명령은 lkp-tests 에서 ebizzy 라는 벤치마크를 사용하는 테스트를 위해 필요한 프로그램들을 설치하고 수행 환경을 준비합니다.\n$ sudo lkp install jobs/ebizzy.yaml job lkp-tests 에서 테스트 수행의 기본 단위는 job 이라고 이야기 하는데, jobs/ 디렉토리 아래에 각 job 을 설명한 yaml 파일이 있습니다. 위의 커맨드에서 인자로 넣은 ebizzy.yaml 은 ebizzy 를 사용한 테스트에 필요한 사항들이 들어있습니다. 이 커맨드는 내부적으로 이 테스트에 필요한 패키지를 설치하고 ebizzy 벤치마크도 소스코드를 인터넷에서 받아다가 컴파일해 설치합니다.\nJob 파일은 또한 해당 테스트가 어떤 시스템 환경들에서 어떤 벤치마크를 어떤 인자를 줘가며 수행해야할지 등에 대한 내용을 담고 있습니다. 예컨대 jobs/aim7-fs-1brd.yaml job 은 xfs, ext4, btrfs, f2fs 파일 시스템 각각에 대해 aim7 을 돌려보도록 되어 있습니다.\n테스트 수행 다음 명령은 ebizzy job 으로 기술된 테스트를 실제 수행시킵니다:\n$ sudo lkp run jobs/ebizzy.yaml job 쪼개기 ebizzy.yaml 은 시스템 소유 CPU 코어 갯수 2배 갯수의 쓰레드를 사용해 ebizzy 를 10초간 돌리는 실험을 100번 반복하도록 되어 있습니다. 즉, 실험의 경우의 수가 하나입니다. 그러나, 앞서 설명한 aim7-fs-1brd 와 같이 다양한 구성을 사용하게 되어 있는 경우, 한가지 구성에 대해서만 반복 실험을 하고 싶을 수 있을 겁니다. 이런 경우 다음 명령으로 job 을 쪼갤 수 있습니다:\n$ sudo lkp split jobs/ebizzy.yaml 이 커맨드는 인자로 넣은 job 파일을 쪼개서 현재 디렉토리에 쪼개진 job 파일들을 저장합니다. 어떤 구성이 쪼개졌는지는 파일 이름으로 볼 수 있습니다. ebizzy.yaml 을 쪼개면 ebizzy-200%-100x-10s.yaml 라는 이름의 한개의 job 파일이 생성됩니다. 앞서 이야기한 aim7-fs-1brd.yaml 을 쪼개면 다음과 같이 많은 수의 job 이 생성됩니다:\naim7-fs-1brd-1BRD_48G-btrfs-creat-clo-4.yaml aim7-fs-1brd-1BRD_48G-f2fs-creat-clo-1500.yaml aim7-fs-1brd-1BRD_48G-btrfs-disk_cp-1500.yaml aim7-fs-1brd-1BRD_48G-f2fs-disk_cp-3000.yaml

테스트에 사용된 벤치마크 수행의 결과와 테스트 동안의 시스템 프로파일링 결과는 /lkp/result/ 디렉토리 밑에 \u0026lt;job name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;configuration\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;host name\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;os distribution

줘서 parsing 된 결과 값도 보여줍니다.\n또한, 최근의 테스트 결과는 테스트 돌린 디렉토리에 result/ 라는 이름의, /lkp/result/ 아래 해당 디렉토리로의 심볼릭 링크를 만들어 줍니다.\nConclusion 이렇게 lkp-tests 가 무엇인지, 그리고 어떻게 사용할 수 있는지 알아봤습니다. 이제, 리눅스 커널 개발 커뮤니티에서 사용하는 리그레션 테스트를 여러분의 환경에서도 손쉽게 돌려볼 수 있습니다.\nReferences [1] https://01.org/lkp/documentation/0-day-test-service\n[2] https://github.com/intel/lkp-tests\n[3]

Jupyter Notebook 환경은 노트북 문서들을 읽어들여 Rich Text 를 저자가 의도한 모습대로 렌더링 해주고, 코드 셀을 사용자가 원하면 셀별로 수행시켜줍니다. 코드 셀의 좌측에 수행 버튼이 떠서, 이를 클릭하면 해당 셀을 수행하는 형태입니다. 문서 상의 모든 코드 셀의 일괄 수행 역시 가능합니다. 이 때, 앞서 수행된 코드 셀의 수행 결과는 다음에 수행되는 코드 셀에 영향을 끼칩니다. 예를 들어 특정 셀에서 전역 변수의 값을 변경했다면 다음에 수행하는 셀에 변경된 전역 변수의 값이 보입니다.\n이를 통해 Jupyter Notebook 사용자는 노트북 문서를 사용해 타인에게 학습시킬 문서를 작성하고 학습자가 곧바로 하나씩 수행해 볼 수 있게 해줄 수 있으며, 스스로 공부하는 사람도 자신이 공부한 내용을 쉽게 정리할 수 있게 해줍니다.\nJupyter Notebook App Jupyter Notebook App 은 Jupyter 노트북 문서를 읽어들여 작성자가 원한 모습으로 보여주고 코드의 수행 등을 대신해 주고, 또한 노트북 문서를 새로 작성할 수 있는 에디터 역할을 합니다. 서버-클라이언트 구조로 되어 있어 로컬 컴퓨터에 서버를 띄우고 웹브라우저로 접속해서 작업할 수도, 다른 컴퓨터에 띄워진 서버에 웹브라우저로 접속해 작업할 수도 있습니다. 일부 공개 Jupyter Notebook 서버도 서비스 되고 있습니다. Google Colab 역시 그런 형태입니다.\nGithub 은 웹인터페이스 상에서 Notebook 문서를 렌더링 해 보여주는 기능을 제공하고 있습니다.\nNotebook kernel 과 Notebook Dashboard 실제 코드의 수행을 담당하는게 Notebook kernel, 각 노트북 문서의 관리를 담당해 주는 인터페이스가 Dashboard 입니다. 커널은 프로그램이 언어별로 존재하며, Jupyter Notebook 에서는 다양한 언어의 커널을 지원하고 있습니다.\nGoogle Colab Jupyter Notebook 은 앞서 설명했듯 자신의 컴퓨터에 설치하고 서버를 띄울수도, 다른 컴퓨터에 설치하고 서버를 띄울 수도 있습니다. ... as a Service 의 시대인 만큼, Jupyter Notebook Server 를 서비스하는 회사들이 많습니다. Google Colab[2] 은 그런 서비스 중 하나입니다. 이 프로젝트는 머신러닝 교육과 연구를 돕기 위해 만들어진 Google 의 연구 프로젝트로, 결국은 하나의 Jupyter notebook 환경일 뿐인데, 어떠한 셋업도 필요 없고 구글 클라우드 위에서 동작합니다.\n노트북 문서는 구글 드라이브에 저장하고 불러올 수 있으며, Github 에 있는 노트북 문서도 읽어올 수 있습니다. 참고로 노트북 문서는 .ipynb 라는 확장자를 사용하는 텍스트 파일입니다.

I also do not prefer such use of debuggers, but admit that sometimes debuggers are quite useful. ;)\nThere are several ways to debug Linux kernel, but one of above is to set up a Linux virtual machine using QEMU and debugging the Linux kernel of the virtual machine from the host machine. This post summarises how to debug the Linux kernel in this way.\nTest Environment The versions and names of the software I used for test of this post are as below.\n Ubuntu 16.04.3 Server gdb 7.11.1 QEMU v2.11.0-dirty Linux v4.16  Kernel Build First, build the kernel you want to debug. You should turn CONFIG_GDB_SCRIPTS on, turn CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED off, and turn CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER on if your target architecture supports it.\nBoot The Virtual Machine If your kernel is ready, boot a QEMU vertual machine with it. You could do it in several ways. For example, you could install the kernel on the virtual machine disk. Or, you could use -kernel, -append and -initrd QEMU option to boot the virtual machine with your kernel image in host machine directly, or some other ways. One thing you should keep in your mind is that you should turn kaslr off. Just giving nokaslr in the kernel parameter doesn\u0026rsquo;t works well.\nPass -s option to QEMU when you start up the QEMU virtual machine, or enter gdbserver in the QEMU monitor console command line. This make the virtual machine to start gdbserver and wait on tcp::1234 for some accesses. If you have given -nographic QEMU option and set the kernel parameter so that the virtual machine\u0026rsquo;s console is connected to your terminal, you could not see the QEMU monitor console directly. In this case, you can go back to QEMU monitor console by entering Ctrl+a c. If you want to go back to the virtual machine\u0026rsquo;s console again, Ctrl+a c \u0026lt;enter\u0026gt;.\nStart gdb Move to the build directory of the kernel to debug, enter gdb vmlinux. This will start up gdb using the symbol and debuggin information of the kernel. Ubuntu or some distributions might fail to read vmlinux-gdb.py. The error message also show you how you can fix it, but in summary, you should append below one line at the end of the .gdbinit file and start the gdb again with the above command:\nadd-auto-load-state-path /path/to/linux-build Now, connect to the QEMU virtual machine by entering below command from the gdb session:\n(gdb) target remote :1234 Remote debugging using :1234 0xffffffff818cce92 in native_safe_halt () at /home/sjpark/linux/arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h:54 54 asm volatile(\u0026quot;sti; hlt\u0026quot;: : :\u0026quot;memory\u0026quot;); Just after you entering this command, QEMU virtual machine will be frozen. From now, you can see the variables of the kernel, set the breakpoint, execute the code step by step, as you normally did with gdb and user space programs. For example, you can set breakpoint to specific function as below:\n(gdb) b cma_alloc Breakpoint 1 at 0xffffffff81240f10: file /home/hacklog/linux/mm/cma.c, line 399. If you want your virtual machine to run again, you can enter c. This will resume the execution of the kernel. If you set a breakpoint as described above and if the code is be executed, the execution will be started on the breakpoint.\n(gdb) c Continuing. If you want the kernel to stop again, enter Ctrl+C in the gdb.\n^C Thread 1 received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 0xffffffff818cce92 in native_safe_halt () at /home/sjpark/linux/arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h:54 54 asm volatile(\u0026quot;sti; hlt\u0026quot;: : :\u0026quot;memory\u0026quot;); (gdb) Use Linux gdb helper Actually, you can normally use gdb even though it failed to load vmlinux-gdb.py. The python script contains some helper scripts for more convenient kernel debugging on the gdb. You can do kernel debugging a little bit more conveniently if you use it.\nList of the helper scripts The helper scripts have lx prefix. You can list up their names and brief descriptions as below:\n(gdb) apropos lx function lx_current -- Return current task function lx_module -- Find module by name and return the module variable function lx_per_cpu -- Return per-cpu variable function lx_task_by_pid -- Find Linux task by PID and return the task_struct variable function lx_thread_info -- Calculate Linux thread_info from task variable function lx_thread_info_by_pid -- Calculate Linux thread_info from task variable found by pid lx-cmdline -- Report the Linux Commandline used in the current kernel lx-cpus -- List CPU status arrays lx-dmesg -- Print Linux kernel log buffer lx-fdtdump -- Output Flattened Device Tree header and dump FDT blob to the filename lx-iomem -- Identify the IO memory resource locations defined by the kernel lx-ioports -- Identify the IO port resource locations defined by the kernel lx-list-check -- Verify a list consistency lx-lsmod -- List currently loaded modules lx-mounts -- Report the VFS mounts of the current process namespace lx-ps -- Dump Linux tasks lx-symbols -- (Re-)load symbols of Linux kernel and currently loaded modules lx-version -- Report the Linux Version of the current kernel So easy, huh? ;)\nReferences  The Kernel Official Document for the Kernel Debugging A blog article The gdbserver official document  ","date":1525684861,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1525684861,"objectID":"5bd42c873c48c75041d53fa45b6fe2d4","permalink":"/post/qemu_kernel_debugging/","publishdate":"2018-05-07T18:21:01+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/qemu_kernel_debugging/","section":"post","summary":"You can use classical debugger for your Linux kernel programming, though Torvalds doesn\u0026rsquo;t like it.

마이그레이션 될 곳에 메모리가 부족해 불가능하거나 하다면 평범한 페이지를 할당받습니다. 이어서 unmap_and_mov() 가 THP 를 평범한 페이지로 쪼개고, 그사이 THP 의 head page 는 split_huge_page() 를 통해 LRU 리스트에 들어갑니다. 같은 일이 THP 할당에 실패할 때도 이러나는데, 이건 에러가 나기 쉬운 행위라고 Michal 은 봅니다.\nLRU 리스트에 split_huge_page() 를 행하는 것도 잘못된 행위인데, 모든 tail page 들이 마이그레이션 되지 않았기 때문이죠. 이로 인해 발생하는 문제는 사용자가 각각 처리해야 했습니다.\nMichal 은 이 패치를 통해 THP 처리를 위한 특수한 부분들을 migrate_pages() 단계로 올려서 이 상황을 정리하고자 합니다. 여기서 unmap_and_move() 가 ENOMEM 으로 실패하면 THP 페이지를 쪼개고 현재 존재하는 리스트로 옮깁니다. 이렇게 함으로써 우리는 모든 THP 서브페이지들을 항상 마이그레이션 하고 특정한 migrate_pages() 사용자들은 앞서 이야기한 경우를 별도로 처리할 필요가 없어지는 것이죠.\n[PATCH]

Amber, Dark, 그리고 IPA. 호박은 좋아하지 않으므로 Dark 와 IPA 를 한잔씩, 그리고 안주로 야채 샐러드를 주문했습니다. 가장 싼 안주이긴 하지만, 맥주 포함해서 가격은 한국돈으로 2만원이 안됩니다. 프라하의 물가에 건배하며 맥주를 마셔봅니다.\n하지만 10월 말인데다 해가 이미 졌고 산위라 그런지 찬바람이 마구 들어옵니다. 오들오들 떨면서도 천천히 다 마셨습니다. 다 마시고 계산하려 하는데 맥주 더 마시겠냐고 하더군요. 맘같아서야 그러고 싶지만 추워서 \u0026ldquo;no thanks\u0026rdquo; 이야기 하고 나왔습니다.\nBack to Old Town of Prague ![foo] (/img/osse_03/26.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_03/27.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_03/1.jpg)\n해가 완전히 져서 돌아오는 길은 완전히 밤입니다. 프라하는 야경도 유명합니다. 돌아오는 길에 프라하 성에 다시 올라가 야경을 감상했습니다. 특히 블타바 강에 비치는 불빛이 멋지더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_03/28.jpg)\n곧바로 숙소로 돌아가기도 그러니 밤중의 프라하도 즐겨보기로 하고 구시가 거리를 천천히 거닐어 봅니다.\nFinish of the Day ![foo] (/img/osse_03/29.jpg)\n아쉽지만 숙소 도착. 낮에 봤던 노점들도 이제 영업을 종료하고 있습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_03/3.jpg)\n맥주가 유명한 곳인만큼 (호스텔 벽에도 써있습니다. 프라하는 맥주가 물보다 싸니까 맥주 많이 마시라고. 전 지역 주민의 충고를 잘 받아들입니다 하하), 체코에서의 매일밤 마무리는 맥주와 함께 해야겠다고 생각했습니다. 그래서 점심에 심카드 사면서 봐두었던 마트에 가서 소세지와 맥주를 사왔습니다. 소세지는 앞의 포스트에서 사진으로도 올려뒀던 소세지 진열대에서 사왔는데, 무게를 재고 가격표를 붙여야 하는데 이걸 해주는 여성분은 영어를 못하시는 것 같더군요. 바디랭귀지로 주문하는데 뭔가 짜증을\u0026hellip; 가장 저렴한 편인 소세지를 샀습니다. 한 조각에 한국돈으로 오백원 정도밖에 안합니다. 우리나라에서 오백원이면 천하장사 소세지 젓가락굵기만한거나 살텐데, 역시 체코 물가 리스펙트합니다. 소세지 맛은 좀 짠 편인데 전 짠걸 잘 먹기도 하거니와, 짠만큼 맥주를 더 마시면 덜 짭니다.\n체코하면 필스너라는 인식이 있는 것 같은데 저 염소 맥주라고도 불리는 Kozel 맥주도 유명하다고 하더군요. 왠지 염소가 맘에 들어 샀는데, 한국돈으로 천원이 안됩니다. 맛은 탁월.\n이렇게 호스텔 휴게공간에서 맥주에 소세지를 함께 하며 하루를 마무리 합니다.\n하루동안 새삼 느낀게, 한국인 여행객이 정말 많더군요. 한시간 이상 한국말 못들은 경우가 많지 않은 거 같습니다. 호스텔에서도 꽤 많은 한국인이 있어서 휴게 공간에서 맥주 마시는 사이에도 앞자리에 한국인 커플과 모녀가 이야기를 나누더군요.\n이제 내일부터 OSSummit 이 시작됩니다. 어떤 흥미진진한 세션들이 있을지, 어떤 재밌는 이벤트가 준비되어 있을지, 커널 커뮤니티에서 메일로만 만났던 커널 개발자들과 만나서 어떤 이야기를 나눌지 기대하며 잠자리에 들었습니다.\n[*] 이 다음 글부터는 OSSummit 이야기가 본격적으로 시작됩니다. 거꾸로, 프라하 여행 정보는 거의 없을 겁니다.\nReferences [1] https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B8%94%ED%83%80%EB%B0%94_%EA%B0%95\n[2]

날카롭다는 인상입니다. 입국할 때 입국심사 카드도 써야하고 여기 숙소 주소 등도 적어야 하고, 지문도 찍어야 하죠. 공항 보안검색대에선 투시카메라로 사진도 찍고. 그래도 뭐 간편하게 가는 편이라 생각했었습니다만 프라하 공항에서 생각이 바뀌었습니다. 대한민국 여권 소지자는 프라하에 갈때에도 비자가 필요없습니다. 입국심사를 위한 카드 작성도 없습니다. 입국심사관은 거의 아무것도 묻질 않습니다. 숙소가 어딘지도 알릴 필요 없고, 뭐하러 왔는지 꼬치꼬치 묻지도 않습니다. 지문도 찍지 않는군요. 정말 편하다는 인상을 받았습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/18.jpg)\n공항 사진입니다. 그렇게 크진 않네요. 아담한 크기의 공항입니다. 그래도 무료 와이파이도 잘 됩니다.\n프라하는 코룬이라는 단위의 통화를 사용합니다. 유로를 받는 곳도 있다고 하지만 왠만하면 코룬을 쓰는게 좋은 것 같습니다. 한국에서도 코룬 환전이 된다고 하는데, 급하게 오느라 미리 하지 못했습니다. 다른 여행객들도 프라하에서 직접 환전하는 경우가 많다고 하는군요. 공항 환전소는 환율이 좋지 않고 시내의 일부 환전소가 괜찮으므로, 공항에서는 시내 가는 교통비 정도만 환전하고, 시내의 추천 환전소에 가서 나머지를 환전하는게 좋다는 이야기가 많더군요. 일단 교통비와 심카드 살 돈을 생각해서 3만원 정도를 환전했습니다. 코룬 환율은 당시 1 코룬당 50원 정도. 수수료를 떼고 약 540 코룬이 제게 떨어졌습니다. 역시 공항 환전은 가성비가 좋지 않네요.\nTo The Hostel 이제 환전도 했으니 숙소로 이동을 해야겠습니다. 컨퍼런스 참가 지원 여부가 늦게 발표된 만큼 숙소도 늦게 잡았습니다. 하지만 특가로 나온 방이 있어 매우 저렴하게 구할 수 있었습니다. 외국에 혼자 나가면 호스텔을 예약하는 편입니다. 저렴한 가격에 각지의 여행객과 만날 수 있어 이득보는 느낌이거든요.\n사실 호스텔에 대한 처음 인상은 별로 좋지 않았습니다. 유럽 여행 가서 호스텔에서 변태 만나고 벼룩에 고생했다는 친구의 이야기도 있었고, 처음 이용했던 호스텔은 2014년에 Google I/O 가서 이용해 봤는데, 방도 엄청 좁고 시설이 열악했거든요. 하지만 두번째로 암스테르담에서 이용했던 호스텔 이후 인식이 완전 바뀌었습니다. 넓고 인테리어도 좋고 함께 방을 썼던 친구들도 유쾌해서 매우 즐거웠던 경험이었습니다.\n어쨌든 이번에 구한 숙소는 프라하 중심가에 위치한 호스텔. 그 가격에 이런 위치라니 시설이 얼마나 안좋길래 이렇게 나머지 조건이 좋은 걸까 걱정이 되기도 했습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/19.jpg)\n프라하에서는 버스, 지하철, 트램 등이 모두 하나의 교통권을 사용합니다. 교통권은 사용 시간대별로 가격이 매겨지며, 그 시간 내에는 환승이 모두 무료. 즉, 30분짜리 교통권을 사면 버스를 한대 타든 두대 타든 지하철을 갈아타든 30분 내에는 추가로 돈을 지불할 일이 없습니다. 전 119번 버스를 타고 나가서 지하철을 타고 시내로 이동할 계획입니다. 구글맵이 그렇게 추천했거든요. 구글맵은 약 40분 걸린다고 이야기 하는군요. 교통권 자판기에서 90분짜리를 뽑습니다. 32 코룬입니다. 한국돈으로 약 1,600원이군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/20.jpg)\n뽑은 교통권입니다. 유효 시간이 90분이라고 적혀 있습니다.\n공항을 나서기전 마지막으로 무료 와이파이를 이용해 필요한 정보를 최대한 미리 검색해두고 폰에 다운로드 받아둡니다. 여길 나서면 숙소에 도착하기 전까지는 인터넷이 불가능하니까요. 심각한 길치인 저로썬 큰 모험입니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/21.jpg)\n여행자들 가는길이 다 거기서 거기인지 여행자인 분들이 함께 움직입니다. 제가 프라하에 도착한 시각은 아침 9시 무렵. 전날 비가 왔는지 땅이 젖어있습니다. 일기예보로는 제가 머무르는 동안 계속 흐리고 때때로 비가 올 예정이더군요.\n프라하 버스 정류장은 모니터로 버스가 어디쯤 오고 있는지 자세히 표시됩니다. 한국 대중교통이 이런 시스템이 잘되어있기로 유명하다고 들었는데, 여긴 더 자세한 것 같다는 인상을 받았습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/22.jpg)\n도착한 버스를 탔습니다. 버스에 타면 승차권을 넣는 기계가 있는데, 거기 집어넣으면 위 사진처럼 집어넣은 시간이 찍힙니다. 표는 중간중간 검표원이 검사를 하게 되는데, 이 때 여기 찍힌 시간과 검사 시각 사이의 시간이 표에 적힌 유효시간 내인지를 보게 된다고 합니다. 버스기사는 딱히 표를 보거나 하지 않습니다. 신뢰를 기반으로 운영되는 시스템인거죠. 검표원을 만나진 못했습니다만, 무임승차 같은 짓은 하지 않기로 합시다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/23.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/24.jpg)\n버스에서 내리고 지하철 타는 길도 여행객들이 다들 우루루 움직여서 그냥 따라가도 되었습니다. 지하철도 상당히 노선이 간단해서 큰 어려움 없이 승차할 수 있었습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/25.jpg)\n지하철에서 내려 땅위로 나왔습니다. 길치가 인터넷으로부터의 실시간 도움 없이 숙소를 찾아야 하는 시간이 왔습니다. 숙소까지는 걸어서 3분 거리인데 역시 헤맸습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/26.jpg)\n길을 헤매는 와중에도 신기한 구경거리는 있습니다. 역시 프라하, 역시 시내 중심지입니다. 지나가는 관광객도 무척 많습니다. 단체 관광객, 가이드를 따라 투어중인 관광객도 많더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/27.jpg)\n그래도 어찌어찌 숙소를 찾았습니다. 호스텔이 쇼핑몰처럼 생긴 건물 안에 있더군요. 의외의 위치선정이라 많이 헤맸습니다. 체크인 수속은 먼저 밟을 수 있지만, 방 청소 시간이 남아있어서 실질 체크인은 오후 두시부터 가능합니다. 등록데스크에 짐을 맡길 수 있으므로, 짐을 맡겨두고 체크인 시간까지 좀 돌아다니기로 합니다. 하지만 먼저 등록데스크의 무료 와이파이에 붙어 최대한 주변 정보를 받아둡니다. 일단 다음 목표는 시내 통신사 대리점에 가서 심카드를 구매하는 겁니다.\nSIM Card for the Internet ![foo] (/img/osse_02/28.jpg)\n거리에선 인터넷이 안되지만 숙소 위치는 파악했고 숙소까지 가면 인터넷이 됩니다. 조금 마음이 편안해지니 주변 경치도 눈에 들어옵니다. 프라하에서 심카드를 구매할 수 있는 통신사로 보다폰, O2, 그리고 T-mobile 이 있습니다만, T-mobile 을 많이들 추천하더군요. 미국 여행 시에도 T-mobile 에서 구매해서 나름 편하게 사용했으므로 T-mobile 대리점을 찾아갔습니다. 그런데, 아뿔싸. 일요일이라 쉬는 날이네요. 숙소로 돌아가 다시 인터넷 검색을 하니 좀 떨어진 위치에 큰 쇼핑몰이 있고 거기에 T-mobile 대리점이 있습니다. 조금 먼 길이라 인터넷 없이 찾아가려니 걱정되지만 일단 출발합니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/29.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/30.jpg)\n그래도 다운받아진 구글 지도가 있고 GPS 가 있으니 생각보다 어렵지 않게 길을 찾아갈 수 있었습니다. 점원 분께 여행자고 심카드를 구매하고자 한다고 하니 능숙하게 안내를 해주시는군요.\n\u0026ldquo;데이터가 필요한가요? 문자는 필요한가요?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;전 데이터만 있으면 되요!\u0026rdquo;\n통화, 문자 없이 1 GB 데이터를 LTE 속도로 30일간 사용할 수 있는 심카드를 약 200 코룬에 구매했습니다. 1 GB 데이터가 너무 많은거 아닌가 싶고 국내에서도 3G 쓰는데 LTE 가 필요한가 싶지만 이게 가장 저렴한 버전이라고 하시는군요. 생각해보면 제가 쓰는 폰인 넥서스5 는 LTE 지원함에도 국내에선 3G 데이터를 썼는데, 외국에서 오히려 LTE 써보네요. 아이러니\u0026hellip;\n개인적으로 외국 나갈때 자주 사용하는 선불심 판매소에서 파는 데이터 유심은 무제한 데이터에 대략 만원 후반대 가격인데, 200 코룬이면 약 만원이니 가성비도 나쁘지 않습니다. 심카드를 꽂고 폰을 재부팅 합니다. 도브리덴! 하는 안내문자가 날아오고 (도브리덴은 체코어로 인사말이라고 합니다), 인터넷이 됩니다. 할렐루야!\nLocal Foods of Prague 대리점을 나오니 바로 앞에 식료품 마트가 있습니다. 많은 외국은 인건비가 비싸서 그런지 음식점에서 사먹는 비용은 비싸지만 식재료는 무척 저렴해서, 직접 요리해 먹으면 우리나라보다도 훨씬 싸게 식사를 해결할 수 있는 경우가 많습니다. 때문에 저는 외국에 나오면 식료품 마트에서 먹을거리를 자주 사먹습니다. 여기가 제 식사의 대부분을 충당할 가능성이 큰 곳이므로 한번 둘러봤습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/2.jpg)\n체코하면 맥주입니다. 체코는 독일을 제치고 일인당 맥주 소비량이 가장 많은 나라입니다. 필스너 우르켈을 만든 나라이기도 하구요. 물보다도 맥주가 싼 가격인 것도 특징입니다. 정말 쌉니다. 대부분의 맥주가 한병에 한국돈으로 천원을 넘지 않습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/1.jpg)\n맥주하면 또 소세지죠! 소세지도 저렴합니다. 여행중 매일밤 여기서 맥주와 소세지를 사서 맥주 한잔씩 하며 하루를 마무리 했습니다.\nSightseeing before Check-in 이제 급한 불은 모두 껐습니다. 숙소도 찾았고, 인터넷도 되고. 하지만 아직도 오후 12시를 조금 넘긴 시간. 체크인도 오후 두시부터이고, OSSummit pre-registration 도 오후 세시부터 시작입니다. 일단 무작정 시내를 돌아다녀 보기로 하고 걸었습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/3.jpg)\n걷다보니 블타바강이 나왔습니다. 강 건너편으로 프라하 성이 아름답게 보입니다. 강변으로 산책로도 조성되어 있고, 강에 선박 레스토랑도 많습니다. 일단 강변을 따라 걸어봅니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/4.jpg)\n천천히 걷다보니 좀 시간이 흐릅니다. 슬슬 체크인 시간이 다가옵니다. 강변에서 빠져나와 숙소쪽으로 천천히 걸어갔습니다. 어디로 걷는지도 모르고 그냥 걸었는데 여기저기 멋진 게 많습니다. 알고보니 여기가 중심지더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/5.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/6.jpg)\n광장입니다. 암스테르담에 갔을때 봤던 중앙 광장이 떠올랐습니다. 사람도 많고 관광객도 많고 볼거리도 많습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/7.jpg)\n나름 유명한 시계 같더군요. 정각엔 인형들이 튀어나와서 뭔가 하고 들어간다는데 이게 몇백년된 시계라고 했던 것 같습니다. 정각에 여기 있질 않아서 인형들이 움직이는건 보지 못했습니다.ㅜㅜ\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/8.jpg)\n길치의 특성 중 하나는 자꾸 샛길로 빠지려는 본능이 있다는 점 아닐까 싶습니다. 반듯이 숙소로 가다가도 자꾸 옆길이 보이니 들어가보고 싶습니다. 장점은 그렇게 발견하는 재미진 곳이 많다는 거죠. 그렇게 발가는대로 걸어보니 재래시장 같은 곳이 나타났습니다. 먹을거리도 팔고, 꼭두각시 인형도 팔고, 기념품도 많이 있습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/9.jpg)\n기내식을 많이 먹었지만 맛깔나게 담아둔 과일이 맛있어 보이더군요. 그래도 돈이 별로 없어서 그냥 참고 지나갑니다.\nBack to the Hostel ![foo] (/img/osse_02/10.jpg)\n드디어 숙소 근처에 도착. 곧 체크인 시간입니다. 잠깐 숙소 근처 거리를 천천히 둘러봤습니다. 이제야 정신차리고 보니 숙소는 바츨라프 광장의 아래쪽에 있었더군요. 그래서인지 숙소 건물 앞 길거리에는 노점이 여럿 있고 관광객들이 거기서 먹을거리와 맥주를 즐기고 있었습니다. 시선과 후각을 강렬하게 끌어당긴 것 중 하나는 이 장작불에 빙글빙글 돌아가며 구워지는 고기! 체코 전통 요리 중 하나인 것 같은데, 주문하면 곧바로 칼로 고기를 일부분 썰어서 빵과 함께 주는 시스템 같습니다. 여기다 맥주까지 함께 판매하니, 안먹고 버티기 힘들정도로 침이 줄줄 흐르더군요. 그래도 전 환전한 돈도 얼마 안되고 해서 참았습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/11.jpg)\n어쨌든 드디어 체크인 시간이 되었으니 숙소로 들어갑니다. 제가 예약한 방은 10인 혼성 도미토리 (dormitory) 룸. 위 사진처럼 다섯개의 이층침대가 있습니다. 일찍 체크인한 덕인지 제가 첫번째인가봅니다. 창가 1층 자리를 선점했습니다. 어쩌면 이 넓은 방을 혼자 쓸수도\u0026hellip;? 했는데 밤에 다들 체크인 하더군요. 하하. 어쨌든 아주 넓진 않지만 좁지 않고 깨끗했습니다. 대만족! 잠깐 인터넷도 하고 간단히 세수도 하고, 이제 뭐할지 계획을 짜봅니다.\n내일부터 OSSummit 시작이니, 낮에 관광을 하는건 오늘이 마지막입니다. 일단 나가서 좀 돌아다녀보고, 컨퍼런스 회장으로 이동해 pre-registration 도 하고, 이어서 프라하 성을 돌아보기로 계획했습니다.\nJourney to OSSummit Pre-registration ![foo] (/img/osse_02/12.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/13.jpg)\n가장 먼저 숙소 바로 앞의 바츨라프 광장을 둘러봤습니다. 약간 경사가 져 있어서 바츨라프 광장 끝의 동상 앞에서 뒤를 돌아보면 프라하 시내가 보이는 경치가 좋더군요. 바츨라프 광장은 서울 광화문 광장과 비슷한데, 민주화 관련 운동도 있었다고 하니 촛불이 가득 채웠던 광화문과 더욱 비슷한 느낌이 들었습니다.\n근데 프라하랑은 개인적으로 딱히 접점이 없어서일까요, 역사라던지가 머리에 잘 들어오지 않습니다. 암스테르담 같은 경우 민주화, 다양성 존중 등이 발전되어 있고 파이썬 창시자인 귀도 반 로썸 아저씨의 고향이라 그런지 꽤 하나하나가 와닿았는데 말이죠. 그래선지 어디가 어딘지도 잘 모르겠고 그냥 헤매듯이 정처없이 거닐었습니다. 그래도 어딜 가든 다 아름답고 멋집니다. 건축물들이 예술입니다. 근데 그래서 더 특색을 모르겠더군요. 저랑 프라하는 잘 안맞나봐요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/31.jpg)\n그렇게 걷다보니 만난 작은 공원. 공원을 원래 좋아하는터라 반가웠습니다. 공원의 반대편은 프라하 중앙역에 연결되어 있더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/32.jpg)\n컨퍼런스 회장으로 이동 중 만난. 뭔지 모를 곳. 낡은 건물이었는데 그 안은 천장이 뚫려있고 기차같은게 운행되고 있더군요. 뭔지 모르겠는데 멋졌습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/17.jpg)\n마침내 도착한 컨퍼런스 회장! 힐트 프라하입니다. 정식 일정은 내일부터지만 오늘도 미리 등록을 할 수 있습니다. 내일 와서 줄서긴 싫기도 하고, 미리 준비중인 회장을 구경하고 싶어서 왔습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/33.jpg)\n등록 부스입니다. 아주 한산할 줄 알았는데 생각보다 사람이 있더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/15.jpg)\n등록 완료했습니다. 이 네임택 하나가, 그렇게 갖고 싶었습니다. 크흑.\n빨간 딱지는 선물 증정 부스에 제출해서 티셔츠 하나, 그리고 리셉션 때 맥주와 바꿀 수 있는 쿠폰을 받을 수 있게 되어 있더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/16.jpg)\n스폰서 기업들이 부스를 차리고 있는 분주한 모습도 볼 수 있었습니다. 내일은 이곳이 어떻게 꾸며질까 미리 어느정도 예상도 할 수 있었습니다.\n이제 어느덧 오후 4시가 되어갑니다만, 아침 9시부터 움직였으니 꽤 많은 일이 있었습니다. 일단 여기서 여행기의 두번째 포스트를 마무리 합니다.\n","date":1509739104,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509739104,"objectID":"7d55d4497916ea2e5579c96eb9a7fd96","permalink":"/post/osse2017_02/","publishdate":"2017-11-04T04:58:24+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/osse2017_02/","section":"post","summary":"Immigration

합동으로 열린 프라하에 다녀왔습니다. 이에 대한 기록을 남겨봅니다.\nThe Event 리눅스 재단에서는 다양한 컨퍼런스를 개최합니다. 2015년까지는 한국에서도 Korea Linux Forum 이라는 행사를 매년 열었죠. 특히 2015년에는 커널 서밋도 함께해서 특히 특별했던 기억입니다. 이런 이벤트들 중에서도 가장 큰 이벤트는 오픈소스 서밋이 아닐까 싶습니다. 이 이벤트는 기존의 리눅스콘 등 행사들이 합쳐진 행사입니다. 가장 큰 이벤트가 오픈소스 서밋이라면 가장 중요한 행사는 커널 서밋이라 할 수 있지 않을까 싶습니다. 커널 서밋은 커널 개발에 중요한 역할을 하는 메인테이너들이 모여 현재 개발 상의 이슈를 공유, 해결책을 토론하고 차후 개발을 위한 회의를 하는 자리입니다. 당연하지만 토발즈도 이 자리에 함께 합니다. 중요 개발자들끼리만 모이는 자리인 만큼 초대 형식으로만 참가할 수 있었는데, 2015년부터는 다른 이벤트와 함께 개최되어서 초반 몇일은 함께 열린 이벤트의 참가자들도 토의에 참여할 수 있게 되었습니다.\n올해는 프라하에서 오픈소스 서밋 유럽지역 행사와 임베디드 리눅스 컨퍼런스 유럽지역 행사, 그리고 커널 서밋이 함께 열렸습니다. 당연히 최신 정보를 얻고 다른 개발자들과 네트워킹을 할 수도 있고, 제 프로젝트인 GCMA 를 홍보할 수도 있는 기회이기에 꼭 참여해야겠다 싶었습니다.\nKOSSLAB 에서는 오픈소스 개발자들의 해외 컨퍼런스 참여를 지원합니다. 자원이 한정되어 있는 만큼 지원이 좀 까다롭습니다. 지원 신청은 발표자 또는 초대장을 받은 사람에 한정되며, 지원은 비행기표 비용이며, 발표자의 경우 호텔비 이틀치를 추가로 지원합니다. 즉, 컨퍼런스 등록비, 숙식을 위한 비용은 각자 부담해야 합니다. 지원한 모두를 지원하는 것도 아니고 내부 심사가 있습니다. 그래도 지원을 받는데 성공하면 매우 큰 도움이 되죠.\n저는 초대장을 받아 신청하게 되었는데, 지원 여부 결과가 꽤 늦게까지 발표되지 않았습니다. 초조하게 기다리고 있다가 어차피 각자 결제 후 차후 영수증을 통한 증빙을 통한 지원이라 전해듣고, 에라 모르겠다 하고 자비로 비행기표 등을 모두 구매했는데 다음날 아침, 지원을 해주기로 결정했다는 전화를 받았습니다. 다시 한번 KOSSLAB 에 감사한 마음을 전합니다 :D\nTo Incheon Airport ![Incheon Airport] (/img/osse_01/1.jpg)\n토요일 밤 인천 공항에서 출발해 이스탄불에서 한번 환승하고 프라하로 가는 터키항공 편을 구매했습니다. 빨래를 하고 짐을 싸며 낮시간을 보냈습니다. 인터넷 연결이 어려울 테니 볼만한 영화도 다운받고, 읽을거리도 인쇄해두고, 참여/관리중인 프로젝트들의 소스코드도 랩톱 안에 최신으로 땡겨둡니다. 해가 질 무렵, 공항으로 출발했습니다. 인천공항 가는길은 지하철을 사용합니다.\nTo Istanbul 알고보니 터키항공은 서비스가 좋기로 유명한 모양입니다. 상도 받았다는 것 같더군요.\n출발한 후에 승객들에게 파우치를 하나씩 주는데, 열어보면 안대와 슬리퍼, 귀마개, 칫솔, 립밤 등이 들어있습니다.\n![to_istanbul] (/img/osse_01/2.jpg)\n좌석에 제공되는 서비스도 좋은 편입니다. 의자에 USB 가 있어 핸드폰과 태블릿 등을 충전할 수 있고고, 좌석마다 달린 디스플레이를 통해 영화, 뉴스, 기내정보, 음악 등을 즐길 수 있습니다. 한글 자막이 제공되진 않지만 한국어 더빙 영화는 일부 있는 것 같습니다. 영어 자막은 대부분의 영화가 제공하므로 대충 누가 나쁜놈이고 착한놈인지 정도는 알아들을 수 있었습니다.\n요즘 비행기는 다들 이정도는 제공하는 것 같기도 하지만, 제 경우는 출장 때 외에는 비행기 타는 일이 거의 없고, 출장갈 때마다 가능한 저렴한 표를 구하는 편이다보니 (내가 힘들게 가는만큼 다른 친구들이 이득보겠거니 해서 그러는데, 굳이 그럴 필요는 없나 싶기도 하군요.) 좋은 비행기 타본 적이 없어서 디스플레이가 있는 비행기는 대략 3년만에 처음입니다. 감동의 눈물이 흘렀습니다.ㅜㅜ 근데 디스플레이 없는 비행기에 이미 너무 익숙해졌는지 영화를 잘 안보게 되는군요.\n![to_istanbul_first_food] (/img/osse_01/3.jpg)\n첫번째 기내식은 비빔밥과 파스타가 제공되었습니다. 한국에서 출발하는 만큼 비빔밥을 준비한 준비성은 좋지만 개인적으로 외국 여행중에는 외국 음식을 먹자는 편이고 고기류를 좋아하는 편이라 파스타를 먹으며 눈물을 흘렸습니다. 신기한건 와인을 주문하면 병째로 줍니다. 하지만 작은 병이라 컵 하나에 가득 따른 정도의 양과 비슷합니다. 한국계 항공사에서 주는것보단 많은 양이지만 델타 등의 미국계 항공사에서 주는 것과 비슷한 정도 같습니다.\n![to_istanbul_second_food] (/img/osse_01/4.jpg)\n내리기 전 제공되는 기내식은 오므라이스와 샌드위치입니다. 가볍게 먹기 좋았습니다.\n![istanbul_airport] (/img/osse_01/5.jpg)\n이스탄불 공항은 화려한 편이었습니다. 화장실은 좀 더러웠지만\u0026hellip; 특히 중간에 터키 아이스크림을 파는 가게가 있었는데, 고객을 놀려대며 즐거움을 주는 모습을 오프라인으로는처음 봤습니다. 신기하더군요. 아쉬운건 무료 와이파이가 없습니다. 정확히는, 있긴 한데 사용을 위해선 패스워드를 SMS 를 통해 받아야 합니다. 로밍을 켤 돈이 없어 그냥 버텼습니다. 환승 시간이 길지 않아 다행이었습니다.\n환승을 위해 게이트에 도착해 기다리는데 함께 기다리는 사람들 중 일부 한국 사람들이 게이트가 바뀌었다며 갑자기 뛰어갑니다. 확인해보니 정말로 바뀌어 있더군요. 이동하는 중에 이에 대한 내용이 뒤늦게 방송으로 나왔습니다. 외국인 분들은 뒤늦게 헐레벌떡 오시더군요. 저도 헐레벌떡이었지만.\n신기한게 게이트에서 여권 검사를 합니다. 덕분에 게이트에 들어가는데에도 줄이 생겼습니다. 머리가 길어 눈이 가려서 그런지 검사하는 분이 같은 사람 맞냐며 생일 등을 물어보는데 좀 긴장되더군요. 그래도 큰 문제 없이 통과. 비행기는 출발합니다.\nTo Prague ![to_prague] (/img/osse_01/6.jpg)\n환승 비행기도 터키항공. 이번 여행은 계속 터키항공만 이용합니다.\n![to_pargue_food] (/img/osse_01/7.jpg)\n두시간 가량의 짧은 비행이지만 기내식이 나옵니다. 이번에도 오므라이스와 샌드위치.\n![pargue!]

One of the most popular OLTP benchamrks is TPC-C, while that of OLAP is TPC-H[2]. This post describes how you can run TPC-H against MariaDB.\nEnvironment Setup The versions of the OS and programs I used for writeup of this post are as below.\n Ubuntu 16.04.2 Server MariaDB 10.2.8 TPC-H toolkit 2.17.2  Automated Scripts I automated whole things I will describe below using scripts and uploaded the scripts to the Github: https://github.com/sjp38/tpch-mariadb\nIf you hano no time, just go to the link and use the script.\nTPC-H Spec You can ge TPC-H benchmark specification from TPC website[3]. Refer to it if you need strict specification of the benchmark. Nonetheless, I give you a rough description of the benchmark here, though. TPC-H stores a huge data into 8 tables and run 22 queries analysing this data. To measure the performance, we can measure the time to store/load the data, runtime of each of the 22 queries, and the throughput (number of processed queries per second) of multiple sessions.\nGet TPC-H Toolkit TPC provides the specification says how the tables should be constructed, what data should be stored in the tables, and what kind of queries should be issued. So, anyone can implement their TPC-H based on this specification. Nonetheless, as manual read of the specification and manual implementation can be boring and exhaustive to someone. For the reason, TPC officially provides a tool, namely TPC-H Toolkit, that helps creation of the tables, the data, and the queries. If you go to the site[4], enter your personal information, and agree to the license, they will send you a link to download the TPC-H Toolkit by mail.\nThe file is in zip format. After extracting the file, you can get the directory named by the version of the toolkit. The source code and license file is under the directory. We will use dbgen/ directory here.\n$ tree 2.17.2 -L 1 2.17.2 ├── dbgen ├── dev-tools ├── EULA.txt └── ref_data Build Source Code Under the dbgen/, there are source code of the programs that we will use, dbgen and qgen.

Before that, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we run TPC-H using the files under dbgen/ directory.\nData Preparation dss.ddl file has the sql statements be used for the creation of the 8 tables. If you command your DB to execute the sql statements in this file, the 8 tables will be created.\ndbgen creates the sql statements that stores the data to the table. If you run the dbgen with optional arguments including scale factor, 8 files having .tbl suffix will be created. Each of these files has query statements inserting the data to the table having same name with the file. You can store the data to the tables by making your DB to run the sql statements.\ndss.ri has a sql statement creating the table index. Once your DB runs these sql statements, the table index will be generated and you will be ready to run the TPC-H queries.\nQuery Creation and Execution qgen creates the queries doing the TPC-H\u0026rsquo;s analysis tasks. We simply said 22 queries, but it would be better to say 22 kinds of queries. If a query is repeatedly issued with same arguments, DB server can cache the results and simply return it to the client. As this can distort the results, TPC-H Toolkit has the template of the 22 queries under dbgen/queries/ directory and let qgen to create query statements using random arguments, based on this templates. The seed for the random number generation is created based on dists.dss file.\nModify TPC-H Toolkit for MariaDB Each DBMS has a little bit different query syntax. Thus, TPC-H Toolkit is made to support multiple DBMSes, but the MariaDB is not in the supported DBMSes. Therefore, you should modify a part of the TPC-H Toolkit to run TPC-H on the MariaDB.\nThe files need modifications are dss.ddl, dss.ri, and the templates under the queries/ directory. As the description of the each of the modifications will be too long, I simply made patches for the modifications and uploaded on Github[5]. You can apply the patch files to your TPC-H Toolkit as below. You should be on the TPC-H Toolkit source code directory while running below command.\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjp38/tpch-mariadb/07fdcbfa9ba1be26f437ff130338a223d0dbfecd/0001-Modify-for-MariaDB.patch $ patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0001-Modify-for-MariaDB.patch The changes above includes the modification of the makefile. After applying, build dbgen and qgen.\nData Creation Now, move to dbgen/ directory and run dbgen. You can give scale factor using its argument. Refer to the usage of dbgen using -h option. After its execution, you can see below 8 .tbl files.\ndbgen$ ls -ahl *.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 187M Sep 9 10:48 customer.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 5.8G Sep 9 10:48 lineitem.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 2.2K Sep 9 10:48 nation.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 1.4G Sep 9 10:48 orders.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 919M Sep 9 10:48 partsupp.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 186M Sep 9 10:48 part.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 389 Sep 9 10:48 region.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 11M Sep 9 10:48 supplier.tbl The above results used scale factor value as 8.\nLoad Data Now, with your MariaDB, create a database named tpch (line 1), create tables under the database (line 2), load the data to the tables (lines 3-5), and make index for each of the tables (line 6).\n$ mysql -u root -p password -e \u0026quot;create database tpch;\u0026quot; $ mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; dss.ddl $ for table in customer lineitem nation orders partsupp part region supplier \\ do mysql -u root -p -e \\ \u0026quot;LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE '$table.tbl' FIELDS TERMINATED BY '|';\u0026quot; done $ mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; ./dss.ri Create Queries Now, create the queries. qgen receives a number from 1 to 22 which means the type of the queries to create, generate the query statement, and print on the screen. You can save the queries with below commands. This example assumes it is executed on the dbgen/ directory.\n$ cd queries/ $ for i in {1..22}; do ../qgen $i \u0026gt; query-$i.sql; done Now, you have 22 query- prefixed files containing each type of queries under the dbgen/queries/ directory.\nExecute Queries As the query files have sql statement compatible with MariaDB, you can simply run them as below.\n$ for i in {1..22}; do mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; dbgen/queries/query-$i.sql Few queries will take few of tens of seconds to complete while another queries take less than 1 second.\nConclusion This post summarised how TPC-H is constructed, how you can run it, and what modifications are required to run it on MariaDB.

This post describes how you can run TPC-H against MariaDB.\nEnvironment Setup The versions of the OS and programs I used for writeup of this post are as below.\n Ubuntu 16.04.2 Server MariaDB 10.2.8 TPC-H toolkit 2.17.2  Automated Scripts I automated whole things I will describe below using scripts and uploaded the scripts to the Github: https://github.","tags":["tpch","benchmark","tpc-h","mariadb","mysql"],"title":"TPC-H on MariaDB (MySQL)","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["tip"],"content":"악의 조직 Oracle 에서 Sun 을 인수한 후 이어진 반 open source 적 행보에 MySQL 개발자는 MySQL 을 fork 해서 MariaDB 를 개발하고 있습니다. 저작권을 악용해 중요한 기능은 천천히 릴리즈 하거나 유료 라이센스로만 공개하기도 하는 Oracle 의 MySQL 과 달리 MariaDB 는 예전 MySQL 처럼 공개적으로 개발되고 있어 새롭고 진보적인 기능도 많이 있는 편인 것 같습니다.\n이 글에서는 Ubuntu 16.04 서버에 MariaDB 를 소스코드부터 가져와서 설치하고 사용하는 간단한 사용법을 정리해 봅니다.\nEnvironment 이 글에서는 Ubuntu 16.04.2 server 버전을 사용합니다.\nBuild and Install MariaDB 는 대부분의 리눅스 배포본을 위한 패키징이 잘 되어 있어서 각 배포본의 패키징 시스템을 사용하면 한두줄의 커맨드로 쉽게 설치할 수 있습니다. 하지만 여기선 문서[1] 를 참고해 가며 소스 코드부터 가져와서 바닥부터 가장 최신 버전을 설치해 보기로 합시다.\n소스코드는 github 에 git repository 의 형태로 공개되어 있습니다. 아래의 명령어로 코드를 mariadb/ 디렉토리 아래에 가져올 수 있습니다.\n$ git clone https://github.com/MariaDB/server.git mariadb $ cd mariadb git repository 인만큼 버전은 git 을 통해 tag 로 관리되고 있습니다. 이 글을 작성 중인 시점에서 가장 최신 stable 릴리즈는 10.2.8[2] 로, 2017년 8월 18일 자로 릴리즈 되었습니다. 다음 커맨드로 해당 버전의 코드를 checkout 할 수 있습니다:\n$ git checkout mariadb-10.2.8 이제 소스코드는 준비되었고, 빌드할 차례입니다. cmake 를 사용해 어떻게 빌드할지 등을 설정할 수 있는데, 여기선 release 할때 사용하는 설정을 사용해 보겠습니다. cmake 가 실패하는 경우는 대부분 필요 패키지가 설치되지 않은 경우입니다. libaio-dev, libjemalloc-dev, libgnutls-dev 등의 패키지가 설치되어 있어야 합니다.\n해당 패키지 설치 후에도 같은 에러 메세지가 나올 수 있는데, cmake 의 기존 결과가 캐싱되어 재사용되기 때문입니다. CMakeCache.txt 와 CMakeFiles/ 디렉토리를 제거해주면 캐싱된 내용은 사라집니다.\n이어서 간단히 make 를 사용해 빌드하고 설치를 할 수 있습니다. 설치는 super user 권한이 필요하기 때문에 sudo 를 사용해야 합니다.\n$ cmake . -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release $ make $ sudo make install 어떤 사양의 머신에서 빌드하느냐에 따라 다르겠지만 빌드하는데 꽤 긴 시간이 걸립니다. 이 글을 작성하며 사용한 72 코어 / 144 쓰레드 머신에서는 -j144 옵션을 줘서 빌드할 경우 1분 5초 걸렸습니다. 별다른 에러 메세지가 없다면 빌드에 성공한 것입니다.\nInitialize MariaDB Server 이제 MariaDB 의 기본 설치는 마무리 되었지만, 아직 MariaDB 구동을 위한 준비가 모두 끝나진 않았습니다. MariaDB 가 제대로 동작하기 위해서는 test database, default user 등등의 최소 데이터를 생성하는 초기화 작업을 진행해야 합니다. 앞의 설치는 MariaDB 실행파일을 만들어 시스템에 설치한 것이고, 이 초기화 작업은 MariaDB 서비스의 설치라고 생각하면 이해가 조금 편할 수도 있겠습니다.\nsuper user 권한의 남용은 보안적으로 위험할 수 있으므로, MariaDB 는 기본적으로 별개의 사용자 계정을 사용할 것을 권장합니다. 다음 예에서는 mysql 이라는 이름의 user 를 생성하고 이 사용자 계정을 사용하도록 해서 초기화를 진행합니다.\n$ sudo adduser mysql $ sudo chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/ $ cd /usr/local/mysql/ $ sudo -u mysql ./scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql 순조롭게 진행되었다면 다음과 같은 메세지를 볼 수 있을 겁니다:\nInstalling MariaDB/MySQL system tables in './data' ... OK To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER ! To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands: './bin/mysqladmin' -u root password 'new-password' './bin/mysqladmin' -u root -h hydra password 'new-password' Alternatively you can run: './bin/mysql_secure_installation' which will also give you the option of removing the test databases and anonymous user created by default. This is strongly recommended for production servers. See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at http://mariadb.com/kb or the MySQL manual for more instructions. You can start the MariaDB daemon with: cd '.' ; ./bin/mysqld_safe --datadir='./data' You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl cd './mysql-test' ; perl mysql-test-run.pl Please report any problems at http://mariadb.org/jira The latest information about MariaDB is available at http://mariadb.org/. You can find additional information about the MySQL part at: http://dev.mysql.com Consider joining MariaDB's strong and vibrant community: https://mariadb.org/get-involved/ Starting MariaDB 이제 준비가 끝났습니다. 앞의 초기화 과정 이후 나온 메세지에서도 알 수 있듯이, 다음 커맨드로 MariaDB 서버를 시작할 수 있습니다:\n$ sudo -u mysql /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysqld_safe --datadir='./data' Connect to Local MariaDB Server MariaDB 는 여러가지 방법으로 접근해 사용할 수 있는데, 관리 목적 등으로는 local shell 을 사용하는게 가장 간단합니다. 다음 커맨드로 local shell 을 열 수 있습니다. 이 커맨드는 같은 기계 위에 띄워져 있는 MariaDB 서버 프로세스에 접속해 해당 서버에 sql 쿼리를 날릴 수 있는 프롬프트를 띄워 줍니다.\n$ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql 위 커맨드에 \u0026ndash;version 인자를 주면 현재 mariadb 의 버전도 볼 수 있습니다:\n$ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql --version /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql Ver 15.1 Distrib 10.2.8-MariaDB, for Linux (x86_64) using readline 5.1 s Kill MariaDB Server 서버를 끝낼 수도 있어야겠죠. 다음의 커맨드로 mysql 서버 프로세스에게 SIGTERM 시그널을 날려서 서버 프로세스를 종료시킬 수 있습니다.\n$ sudo -u mysql kill -SIGTERM `pidof mysqld` Basical Usage 프롬프트에서 다음과 같이 기본적인 sql 쿼리를 날릴 수 있습니다.\n$ sudo /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql \u0026gt; create database sj_db; \u0026gt; create table sjtable ( id INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(20) ); \u0026gt; insert into sjtable values ( 1, 'Will' ); \u0026gt; select * from sjtable; 그 외의 MariaDB sql 문법을 위해서는 MariaDB basic sql statement 문서[3] 를 참고합시다.\nmy.cnf configuration mysql 과 마찬가지로 MariaDB 역시 my.cnf 파일을 사용해[1] 대부분의 설정을 구성합니다. 기본적으로 /etc/my.cnf, /etc/mysql/my.cnf \u0026hellip; 순으로 설정 파일을 찾게 되며, mysqld_safe 실행파일 실행 시에 \u0026ndash;defaults-file 인자로 파일 경로를 줄수도 있습니다. 소스 코드 디렉토리의 support-files/ 디렉토리 아래에 my-huge.cnf, my-large.cnf, my-medium.cnf 등의 예제 설정도 있습니다.\n앞의 과정을 따라서 설치하면 /etc/ 아래에 my.cnf 파일이 없을 겁니다. 이 때의 기본 설정은 어떻게 되는지는 다음 커맨드를 통해 알 수 있습니다.\n$ /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -NBe 'SHOW VARIABLES' askapache.com 에서는[5] 이를 이용해 기본 my.cnf 를 추출하는 커맨드도 소개하고 있으니 필요하면 참고하시기 바랍니다.\nData Directory Specification 실험용으로 MariaDB 를 사용하는 경우라면 MariaDB 데이터를 최초 상태로 백업해 두거나 서로 다른 설정의 데이터를 유지해야 할 수도 있습니다.\nMariaDB 의 default data directory 는 /usr/local/mysql/data/ 로, 프롬프트에서\n\u0026gt; select @@datadir; 명령으로 현재 띄워진 MariaDB 서버 프로세스가 사용중인 data directory 의 경로를 볼 수 있습니다. 이 경로는 my.cnf 상에서 수정할 수도 있고, mysqld_safe 실행 시 \u0026ndash;datadir 옵션으로 지정할 수도 있습니다. 주의할 점은, 이때 \u0026ndash;datadir 인자로 주는 데이터 디렉토리는 한번은 scripts/mysql_install_db 를 실행해준 디렉토리여야 한다는 것입니다. mysql_install_db 명령에도 \u0026ndash;datadir 인자를 줄수 있습니다.\nConclusion MariaDB 최신 버전의 소스코드를 가져와 빌드하고 설치해서 사용하는 방법을 알아봤습니다. 하나의 예제로 정리해 보자면 다음과 같습니다.\n$ git clone https://github.com/MariaDB/server.git mariadb $ cd mariadb $ git checkout mariadb-10.2.8 $ cmake . -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release $ make $ sudo make install $ sudo adduser mysql $ sudo chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/ $ cd /usr/local/mysql/ $ sudo -u mysql ./scripts/mysql_install_db --datadirr='./data' \u0026amp;

Address randomization[3] 이 한 예입니다. 따라서 Address randomization 이 가줘져 있다고는 하지만 해당 어드레스를 누구나 볼 수 있는 커널 로그에 뿌리는 것도 좋은 행위는 아닐 뿐더러, 이렇게 나온 정보는 시스템에 따라 무효할 것이기 때문에 적어도 커밋 메세지에는 존재할 필요가 없는데 버그 레포팅 할때 사람들이 뿌려대서 귀찮기만 하다는 것이죠.\nHow to find out the Line, now? 문제는, 이렇게 되니 기존의 addr2line 을 이용해 한방에 해결되던 위치 찾기가 좀 복잡해진다는 겁니다. 먼저 해당 함수의 메모리 상 위치를 찾아내고, 그 다음 오프셋을 더해서 해당 코드의 메모리 상 주소를 찾아내어서 다시 addr2line 등을 사용해야 하는 것이죠.\n이게 귀찮다면 만능 도구 gdb 를 사용할 수 있습니다:\n$ gdb ../linux.out/vmlinux ...

Test 는 정확성 테스트만을 위한, 빨리 끝나는 데이터로 이 인자를 주지 않으면 default 로 이 값이 취해집니다. native 는 가장 realworld workload 에 가까운 벤치마크를 위한 데이터라 볼 수 있습니다.\n-p 옵션을 통해 어떤 sub benchmark 를 돌릴지 정할 수 있습니다. 이 옵션을 별도로 주지 않으면 모든 benchmark 를 돌리게 됩니다.\n-n 옵션은 number of threads to use 입니다.\n예를 들어 parsecmgmt -p canneal -a run -i native -n 1 은 canneal sub benchmark 하나만을 쓰레드 한개 써서 native 데이터셋으로 실행합니다.\nReferences [1] http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Documentation\n[3] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/snipersim/_1qpbmpPRtg\n","date":1495142595,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1495142595,"objectID":"8e46345b86c038624f56bc739102ecc7","permalink":"/post/parsec_3_howto/","publishdate":"2017-05-19T06:23:15+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/parsec_3_howto/","section":"post","summary":"PARSEC 은 멀티쓰레드 프로그램들로 구성된 benchmark suite 입니다. 멀티쓰레드로 구성되어 있기 때문에 멀티코어 시스템에서의 multi core scalability 를 테스트 하기에도 적합합니다. 이 글에선 현재 최신 버전인 3.0 버전의 PARSEC 을 Ubuntu 16.04 server 에 설치하면서 겪는 문제의 해결법과 간단한 사용법을 정리해 봅니다.\nToolbox for PARSEC 3.0 on Ubuntu Xenial 아래의 내용을 하나하나 읽어가면서 따라하는 것도 귀찮은 일입니다. 그래서 아래에서 설명하는, Ubuntu Xenial 에서 PARSEC 3.0 을 돌리기 위해 필요한 작업을 대부분 자동으로 해주는 도구들을 만들어 두었습니다.","tags":["parsec","benchmark","parsec3.0"],"title":"Parsec 3.0 설치 / 사용법","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["tip"],"content":"여러개의 리눅스 데스크탑 PC 를 한 책상 위에서 사용하는 경우가 있다. 이 때, 한 PC 에서 Ctrl-C 해서 clipboard 에 복사한 내용을 다른쪽 PC 에서 Ctrl-V 로 붙여넣고 싶은 경우가 있다. 여러가지 해결책이 있겠으나, 다음과 같이 ssh 와 xclip 을 사용해서 해결할 수도 있다:\n$ ssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;remote host\u0026gt; 'DISPLAY=:0 xclip -o -selection clipboard' | \\ xclip -i -selection clipboard 참고: http://askubuntu.com/questions/513442/can-two-pcs-with-ubuntu-share-the-clipboard-buffer\n","date":1490936034,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1490936034,"objectID":"daea1fe5115c771377070515ac3528f2","permalink":"/post/xclip_copy_remote_clipboard/","publishdate":"2017-03-31T13:53:54+09:00","relpermalink":"/post/xclip_copy_remote_clipboard/","section":"post","summary":"여러개의 리눅스 데스크탑 PC 를 한 책상 위에서 사용하는 경우가 있다. 이 때, 한 PC 에서 Ctrl-C 해서 clipboard 에 복사한 내용을 다른쪽 PC 에서 Ctrl-V 로 붙여넣고 싶은 경우가 있다. 여러가지 해결책이 있겠으나, 다음과 같이 ssh 와 xclip 을 사용해서 해결할 수도 있다:\n$ ssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;remote host\u0026gt; 'DISPLAY=:0 xclip -o -selection clipboard' | \\ xclip -i -selection clipboard 참고: http://askubuntu.com/questions/513442/can-two-pcs-with-ubuntu-share-the-clipboard-buffer","tags":["tip","xclip"],"title":"원격 데스크탑의 clipboard 를 ssh 와 xclip 으로 복사해오기","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["tip"],"content":"SPEC, which is a standard corporation for the benchmark[1], makes and shares various benchmark suites.

You can buy SPEC CPU 2006 in DVD or .iso file format (As of March 2017, the cost of the SPEC CPU 2006 v1.2 is $800). There are source code of the benchmarks, source code of tool programs that helps compile, execution, and verification of the benchmarks, pre-compiled tool programs, rule files for the execution of the benchmarks, and documents. This post is written basedon SPEC CPU 2006 v1.1. If you got the .iso file, you can access to the files in it by mounting it as below:\n$ mkdir tmnt $ sudo mount -o loop SPEC_CPU2006v1.1.iso ./tmnt $ ls tmnt It is ok to directly install and execute the benchmarks, but I prefer to first copy the files outside of the mounted dir. The owner of the files is root, as the above command mounted the file via the sudo command. Change the owner to you as below:\n$ mkdir SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ cp -R ./tmnt/* SPEC_CPU2006v1.1/ $ sudo umount ./tmnt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -fr ./tmnt $ sudo chown -R \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ sudo chmod -R 755 SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ cd SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 Build The Tools The .iso file has executable binaries for the tools, which is built for various platforms such as redhat and suse. But, there is no binary for Ubuntu. Therefore, you should build the tools from the source code as below:\n$ cd tools/src $ ./buildtools buildtools is a shell script which builds tools under tools/src. But, you may encounter some errors. Following sections describe the errors and how you can solve it.\nConflicting types for \u0026lsquo;getline\u0026rsquo; Build of md5sum will show you following error message:\ngcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I/home/sjpark/SPEC_CPU2006v1.1/tools/output/include -I. -Ilib -c -o md5sum.o md5sum.c In file included from md5sum.c:38:0: lib/getline.h:31:1: error: conflicting types for 'getline' getline PARAMS ((char **_lineptr, size_t *_n, FILE *_stream)); ^ Type conflict is occurred because getline() and getdelim() functions are declared in stdio.h, but those are declared again in getline.h file.

Below simple one command do that for you.\n$ source ./shrc Running Workload runspec program is used for the execution of each benchmark. This program is located under bin/ dir of the SPEC CPU source code, but you can use it directly without entering path, as the above envrionment variables setting has registered it as $PATH. For example, if you want to execute mcf benchmark, you can use below command:\n$ runspec --iterations 1 --size ref --action onlyrun --config config.cfg --noreportable mcf This command executes mcf benchmark and prints the path to the log file describing the execution results.\n...

Existing physically contiguous memory allocators generally have critical limitations. For example, the most commonly adopted solution, the memory reservation technique, wastes a significant amount of memory space. Scatter/Gather direct memory access (DMA) and input-output memory management units (IOMMUs) avoid this problem by utilizing additional hardware for address space virtualization. However, additional hardware means an increase in costs and power consumption, which is especially disadvantageous for small systems and they do not provide real contiguous memory. Linux Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA) aims to provide both contiguous memory allocation and to maximize memory utilization based on page migration, but they suffer from unpredictably long latency and a high probability of allocation failure. Therefore, we introduce a new solution to this problem, the guaranteed contiguous memory allocator (GCMA). This guarantees efficient memory space utilization, short latency, and successful allocation. The GCMA uses a reservation scheme and increases memory utilization by sharing the memory with immediately discardable data. Our evaluation of a GCMA on a Raspberry Pi 2 finds a latency that is 15-130 times lower compared to a CMA, and a latency that is up to 10 times lower when taking a photo. Using a large working set in a memory-fragmented high-end system, the GCMA is able to produce a 2.27× speedup.\nSource Code The source code for this version has been submitted to LKML for discussion.

Existing physically contiguous memory allocators generally have critical limitations. For example, the most commonly adopted solution, the memory reservation technique, wastes a significant amount of memory space. Scatter/Gather direct memory access (DMA) and input-output memory management units (IOMMUs) avoid this problem by utilizing additional hardware for address space virtualization. However, additional hardware means an increase in costs and power consumption, which is especially disadvantageous for small systems and they do not provide real contiguous memory.","tags":["projects","gcma"],"title":"GCMA: Guaranteed Contiguous Memory Allocator","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["about"],"content":"Bio SeongJae Park is a programmer who loves to analyse and develop systems just for fun.\nContacts  sjpark@amazon.com sj38.park@gmail.com  Education  Ph.D, Computer Science and Engineering at Seoul National University, Aug 2019 B.S., Electrical Engineering / Information and Computer Engineering (dual degree) at Ajou University, Jan 2009  Experiences  Kernel / Hypervisor Engineer at Amazon, Sep 2019 - Present Graduate Research Assistant at DCSLAB, Seoul National University,\nJul 2012 - Aug 2019 Part-time Linux Kernel Hacker at Korea Open Source Software Lab,\nJan 2016 - May 2019 Full-time Linux Kernel Hacker at Korea Open Source Software Lab,\nDec 2013 - Dec 2014 Free-lance S/W Developer, Aug 2011 - Nov 2013 Software Engineer at Samsung Electronics, Feb 2009 - Jul 2011 Software Engineer at Samsung Software Membership, Jan 2008 - Jan 2009  Publications And Presentations  SeongJae Park, Paul E.

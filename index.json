As a result, it got the 1st and 2nd biggest changes among the three projects, in terms of the changed files and lines of code. Nonetheless, the number of commits for lazybox is much smaller than those for the other two projects.

I also heard a few of my previous colleague kernel developers use their Macbook for kernel builds.\nUnfortunately I cannot install Linux kernel on the laptop at the moment, though. I hence created a Debian13 VM on it using UTM and ran the kernel compile benchmark. I use UTM since a few web search results warned me QEMU might have some problems with GUI. I want Gnome desktop for making slides for my future talks. Anyway, the performance of the VM is not bad: a couple of minutes for building a kernel.

My 10 years old personal laptop (Thinkpad X1) used to build a kernel per a couple of hours. The last time I built kernel on the laptop was about 8 years ago. Since then, I was always using only workstation or server level machines for building kernels.\nSo I wanted to know how good modern normal desktop-level machines are, by myself. Also I was about to lose access to my previous development environment, and expecting a few weeks for setting a new one.\nSo I bought a ~$320 mini PC from Amazon. On the machine, I installed Debian13 desktop and ran kcbench.

I\u0026rsquo;d say this is not bad for small kernel hacking setup. While the build is ongoing, I can definitely hear the fan is running. But that\u0026rsquo;s not that bad. At least not worse than the fan for myself that I use in summer.\nI also setup a QEMU-based virtual machine, providing 8 cores and 16 GiB memory.

I even traveled with it. I brought bluetooth keyboard (having a trackpoint like Thinkpad laptops) and an HCMI cable together, and connected the machine with a tv in the hotel room. It was weird to code on the bad, but anyway it worked with no problem.\nSo my take on these results I got so far is that the world has been much more kind for hobbyist kernel hackers.

Around 2,500 commits of around 45,000 lines of change in total. I remind and find a few interesting points below from the numbers.\nThe last commit to perfbook Korean translation was February 2024, since I completed the translation of the second edition, which I started since 2021. I may do the translation from the scratch again, once the third edition is tagged. I highly recommend every programmer to read the book, since it is not only about performance and parallelism but general software engineering, in my opinion.\nMy last commit to lazybox was July 2024. It is a bit surprise to me, since most of my hobby programming time was spent on it for many years. I might became a boring man, or just became busy for other projects. Hopefully I will revisit it next year.\nThe number of changes to hkml is pretty impressive to me. I made changes for hkml even more than those for damo. I actually made an official support commitment this year, and looking forward to introduce it to more people in FOSDEM'25, to promote more DAMON contributors.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/my_opensource_commits_stat_2024/","summary":"As today is the last day of 2024, I checked my open source commits statistics using my simple and buggy scripts.

Dealing with the large amount of mails was not that easy, probably due to my poor setup and being lazy at trying more tools.\nIn 2019, while returning from Linux Plumbers Conference, I read an LWN article saying Linus Torvalds is now considering unsubscribing the linux kernel mailing list, owing to the evolvement of the public-inbox and lore.kernel.org.\nlore.kernel.org was so nice but I wanted some more personalized mails management setup, and wanted to avoid the dependency on the web browser and the internet. I hence further looked into the internal of public-inbox a bit. The git-based mails management structure of public-inbox made me believe maybe I could hack my own mail client using it. I hence started the hackermail project. After about a few weeks of the hack, I replaced some parts of my mail workflow with the new tool, namely hkml, and it became much better than before. It looked like there were many more things that I could improve with it, but because it was already enough for my personal workflow, I stopped working on the project for a while. I only fixed some bugs and implemented features as required for myself.\nAfter I started using hackermail, I met a few kernel hackers who reached out to me asking how I manage mails. They were also finding a better way for the kernel mails management. I introduced them hackermail and my workflow. Because it was optimized for only my personal workflow, my answer was not that helpful for them. They gave me many helpful advice, though. I added some TODO items for them but didn\u0026rsquo;t prioritize and work for those.\nA few months ago, I learned that too many gmail accounts subscribing linux kernel mailing list can be a problem. I personally want every discussion to Cc linux-kernel@, but don\u0026rsquo;t want to make kernel.org have the problem. Hence I unsubscribed the mailing lists and decided to improve hkml to a level that I can migrate all my workflow on it. I also wanted it to be good enough for not only my workflow but also for general. At least the old TODO items should be removed.\nSo I hacked on it in personal time again. After a few months of such a hack, now I feel I made all the features I wanted to have. The old todo items are now removed. Some of the items were added for not myself but others, but some of those turned out to be very helpful for me, too. Now I think my workflow itself is much more improved.\nDue to my tiny source of ideas rather than the quality of the tool, now I show not many TODO items. Hence, I tagged the current version of the tool as v1.0.0. I hope it answers the questions on my mail management workflow, better than those of the past.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/hackermail_v1/","summary":"I started subscribing linux kernel mailing list with my gmail account in 2013.

No. CONF. 2017.\nIn 1987, five minute rule, which means data accessed for every 5 or less minutes are better to be in DRAM than HDD, has found. As the storage devices emerge, the rule has revisited for every decade. This paper revisits it again, in 2017.\nThis paper classifies storage devices in four tiers: performance, capacity, archival, and backup.\nData for latency-sensitive interactive analytics should be in the performance tier, while data for latency-insensitive batch analytics should be in the storage tier.\nFor state-of-the-art PCIe SSDs, the bread-even interval predicted by the five-minute rule is less than a minute.\nThe break-even interval between the devices are as below:\nDRAM-HDD: 5m in 1987, 5m in 1997, 1.5h in 2007, and 4h in 2017 DRAM-SSD: 15m in 2007, 7m for read / 24m for write in 2017 (a sentence in the paper says this is only 40 seconds in 2017, confusing\u0026hellip; Maybe for 3D XPoint like things only) SSD-HDD: 2.26h in 2007, 1d in 2017 Exploring the Design Space of Page Management for Multi-Tiered Memory Systems https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc21/presentation/kim-jonghyeon\nKim, Jonghyeon, Wonkyo Choe, and Jeongseob Ahn. \u0026ldquo;Exploring the Design Space of Page Management for Multi-Tiered Memory Systems.\u0026rdquo; 2021 {USENIX} Annual Technical Conference ({USENIX}{ATC} 21). USENIX} Association, 2021.\nThis paper explores a better way for tiered memory management. It considers access tier of each page in addition to the access locality (whether the page is placed on the local memory or remote memory). That is, Linux uses local PMEM instead of remote DRAM, when local DRAM is full. This paper says it should use remote DRAM instead in the case, as remote DRAM is faster than local PMEM. Based on the finding, the authors proposes their new page placement scheme, which uses AutoNUMA facility to check access frequency and do demotion/promotion proactively. The authors says it achieves 3.5x speedup compared to Intel\u0026rsquo;s recent approach, which Huang Ying is doing.\nFor the evaluation, the authors has used graph500, SpecACCEL, GraphMat, and Liblinear.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/paper_reading_2021_q4/","summary":"record interesting papers that I (partially) read","title":"Papers I read in 2021 Q4"},{"content":"I will present DAMON/DAMOS in KernelSummit'21.

The approach is quite similar to that of daphicx or similar things. It injects data access profiling code in the target program, build and run it with some workload, collect the profiling code-generated results, analyze the profile results to figure out what kind of optimization can provide some benefit to the program, injects the optimization code in the program, built it again, and deploy the version to the production.\nBiggest novelty of DMon is its selective profiling. It first figure out for what resource (e.g., CPU, L1/L2/L3$, or memory) the program\u0026rsquo;s performance is bounded, and select what information to collect based on that. It also uses a simple sampling technique. The default sampling rate is 1 sample per 1000 events, though it can be tuned by user. In this way, DMon profile only necessary information and therefore incurs only small overhead (1.36% on average). This allows DMon to do the profiling not only under production-like workloads but also real production.\nFor the optimization, it uses some existing well-known techniques including (in)direct prefetching, and structure merging, based on the analyzed profiling results. The paper claims this provide 16.83% speedup on average. For the evaluation, the authors use some benchmarks including PARSEC3/SPLASH-2X, NPB, TPC-H on PostgreSQL, and Renaissance benchmark suite.\nThe idea is novel and makes sense. However, because this is a compiler-based approach, it has a limitation in language. It supports only C and C++ for now. Also, though it claims it can be used on production, I unsure if real production people agrees. Especially, the re-deployment of the optimized version would not be so easy for long-running systems.\nRearchitecting Linux Storage Stack for µs Latency and High Throughput https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi21/presentation/hwang\nWhen latency-sensitive apps and throughput-bound apps are co-running, Linux kernel cannot achieve microseconds-scale latency and high throughput. Both SPDK and advanced SPDK usage are same. This paper finds the storage stack of Linux kernel is somewhat like network switch, because it routes I/O request from CPU cores to input queues of storage devices. This paper introduces blk-switch, which modifies the stack to decouple request processing from the application cores and utilizing multiple egress queue having several advanced features including prioritization and steering. It achieves microseconds-scale latency and high throughput under the situation, without modification of the application.\nBeyond malloc efficiency to fleet efficiency: a hugepage-aware memory allocator https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi21/presentation/hunter\nThis paper optimizes TCMALLOC by making it more aware of hugepage and using it on Google\u0026rsquo;s warehouse scale computing. The optimization is mostly based on some model-based heuristics. It\u0026rsquo;s description on TCMALLOC internal and the problem background is quite useful.\nNap: A Black-Box Approach to NUMA-Aware Persistent Memory Indexes https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi21/presentation/wang-qing\nIntel released Optane PM DIMM, so real PM world has already started long time ago. This paper explores the performance of the PM indexing on NUMA systems. It finds PM performance is degraded on NUMA systems, and current NUMA-aware PM indexing systems are not working good enough for NUMA systems. Based on findings that most of the real world workloads have highly skewed access pattern, the authors implemented a system called Nap, which translates the PM indexing to be NUMA-awared.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/osdi2021_papers_review/","summary":"This post is for recording some notes from a few OSDI'21 papers that I got fun.\nDMon: Efficient Detection and Correction of Data Locality Problems Using Selective Profiling https://www.usenix.org/system/files/osdi21-khan.pdf\nDMon is a compiler-based data locality optimization system.

아마도요. 또는, 그 프로젝트들이 필요했던 그 수많은 사람들 가운데 저만이 유일하게 그 일을 실제로 행하고 그걸 되게 만든 것이었을까요?\n저의 자존심은 후자를 선호합니다만, 정직성은 행운 역시 정말 필요하며 옳은 프로젝트, 사람들이 정말로 필요로 하는 프로젝트를 고르는게 정말 필요하다고 말하도록 하는군요.\n하지만 그런 종류의 \u0026ldquo;큰 질문들\u0026rdquo; 을 무시하고 생각해 보면, 오픈소스 메인테이너라면 중요하다고 제가 생각하는, 몇가지 실용적이고 현실적인 것들이 있습니다.\n그런 중요한 것 중 하나는 당신이 거기에 있어야 한다는 겁니다. 당신은 거기에 있어야 하고, 다른 개발자들을 위해 거기 있어야 하며, 항상 거기 있어야 합니다. 당신은 기술적 문제를 맞닥뜨릴 테고, 그건 무척 좌절감을 줄 겁니다. 당신은 그 기술적 문제들을 어떻게 해결할지에 대한 다른 아이디어를 가졌을 수 있는 사람들과 일하게 될겁니다. 그리고 기술적 문제들은 어떤 측면에서 보자면 쉬운 부분인데, 보통은 기술적 해결법이 존재하고, 당신은 종종 객관적으로 \u0026ldquo;이게 더 낫다/빠르다/간단하다/\u0026rdquo; 또는 뭐라고든 말할 수 있습니다.\n그보다 어려운 부분은 당신이 좋아하지 않는, 또는 당신을 좋아하지 않는 사람들과도 결국은 소통해야 할 수 있다는 것이고 성격적 부딪힘도 있을겁니다. 그러면 여러분은 \u0026ldquo;내게 숫자를 보여줘\u0026rdquo; 전략으로 후퇴할 수 없습니다 - 사람들은 항상 혼자 있지 않게 마련이며, 그건 숫자 놀이가 아닙니다. 여러분은 궂은 날들을 겪게 될 것이며, 당신이 함께 일하는 사람들도 마찬가지일 겁니다. 그리고 여러분은 그걸 모두 뚫고 나아가야 합니다.\n당신은 휴식을 취할 수 없다고 말하는 게 아닙니다. 전 항상 그러고 있습니다. 지치면, 전 그냥 컴퓨터 앞을 떠나서 책이나 뭔가를 읽을 겁니다. 당신이 지치거나 화났을 때 무언가 생산적인 일 (또는 토론) 을 억지로 하려 하는건 좋지 않습니다. 그리고 전 분명 이걸 항상 잘하지는 못했고, 사람들을 모욕하고 너무 거친 말을 사용했습니다. 이제는 좀 나아졌다고 생각합니다만, 제가 그걸 더 잘하는 한가지 방법은 말 그대로 더 자주 물러나는 겁니다 - 적극적으로 \u0026ldquo;난 지금 나쁜 기분에 빠져 있습니다\u0026rdquo; 라고 알리고 컴퓨터에서 물러나기를 시도하는 거죠.\n그러니 끊임없다는 의미로 \u0026ldquo;항상\u0026rdquo; 거기 있어야 하는 건 아닙니다. 하루 쉬는 건 괜찮습니다. 일주일을 쉬어야 하는 건 사람들에게 알려야 하는 일일 수 있습니다. 한달을 쉬는건? 그 때에는 관리 계획을 세워야만 하고, 리눅스의 30년간 그게 실제로 두번 일어났습니다: 한번은 kernel.org 가 망가져서 사람들이 모든게 고쳐졌다는 걸 분명히 하기 위해 많은 시간을 쏟았던 때이고, 두번째는 제가 제 행동을 통제 하에 두어 보려 휴식을 취했을 때입니다.\n제가 말하고자 하는건 큰 프로젝트를 관리하는 건 상당한 양의 일이고, 여러분이 오랫동안 지속해야 하는 무언가라는 점입니다. 그게 모두 즐겁기만 하지는 않습니다. 그건 흥미로운 일입니다. 도전적이라는게 최선의 설명 같군요. 전 커널 메인테이너로써의 일에 따분해지진 않았습니다. 하지만 항상 장밋빛인 것도 아닙니다. 모두가 그런 종류의 일을 하고 싶어하지는 않습니다.\n또다른 중요한 건 당신이 개방적이어야 한다는 겁니다. 그리고 전 이걸 여러 방향으로 의미합니다. 일을 사적으로 토론하는 내부 비밀집단을 만들고 최종 결과만을 (또는 핵심이 아닌 작업물만을) 공개하는 형태의, 일종의 \u0026ldquo;파벌\u0026rdquo; 을 만드는 건 정말 쉽습니다, 모든 중요한 것들은 회사 내부나 핵심 그룹 내에서 일어나며 외부 사람들은 그 파벌 내부로 들어가기가 힘들며, 그건 무척 사적이고 배타적인 관계로 그 핵심 그룹 내에서 무슨 일이 일어나고 있는지 알아보는 것만 해도 힘들기 때문입니다.\n이게 제가 공개된 메일링 리스트를 좋아하는 이유 가운데 하나입니다. \u0026ldquo;초대 기반\u0026rdquo; 리스트가 아니라요. 참여하기 위해 서명을 할 필요조차 없죠. 정말 열려 있습니다. 그리고 거의 모든 개발 관련 토론이 거기서 이루어져야 합니다.\n하지만 \u0026ldquo;개방성\u0026rdquo; 은 또다른 방향으로도 중요합니다 - 다른 사람의 해결책에 개방적이 되고, 무엇이 어떻게 되어야 하는지에 대한 매우 분명하고 유동성 없는 아이디어를 갖지 않는 것. 리눅스가 성공한 이유 가운데 하나는 제가 실제로 거대한 계획을 가지고 있지 않았다는 점, 그리고 그게 어떻게 되어야 할지에 대한 높은 기대감을 갖지 않았으며, 때문에 사람들이 패치나 기능들을 위한 요청을 보내기 시작했을 때, 제게 그것들은 모두 소중했고 리눅스가 어떠해야 하는지에 대한 선입견이 없었다는 사실이라고 생각합니다. 결과적으로: 리눅스 커널 개발에 참여하고자 했던 그 개개인 (그리고 나중에는 큰 회사들) 모두는 그러기가 쉬웠는데, 전 제가 처음에 정말 흥미 없던 것들을 리눅스가 하게 되는 것에 상당히 개방적이었기 때문입니다.\n그리고 마지막으로, 전 \u0026ldquo;개방성\u0026rdquo; 이 정직성 측면에서도 중요하다고 생각합니다. 사람들 뒤에서 정치질 하는 걸 원치 마세요. 여러분의 동기를 공개하고, 여러분이 왜 그걸 하고 무얼 하고 싶은지 공개하세요. 함께 일하는 모두를 좋아해야 할 필요는 없고, 그들도 당신을 좋아할 필요는 없습니다, 하지만 사람들이 자신들이 무얼 하고자 하며 무얼 하고 있는지에 대해 공개적이 된다면, 여러분이 항상 최고의 친구가 되어야만 하는건 아닙니다 - 가장 중요한 건 여러분이 그들을 믿을 수 있다는 겁니다.\n믿음은 중요하니까요. 많이.\nJA: 덜 코딩하는 것, 소통과 리딩을 더 하는 것에 대해서 이미 말씀하신 것에서 더 나아가서, 당신이 배워야 했는데 그게 어려웠던 특별한 기술이 있었나요? 예를 들어, 권한 위임하기, 더 나은 글쓰기, 그리고 다른 코딩 외의 기술들 - 그리고 그렇다면, 그걸 어떻게 배웠나요? 실습을 했나요, 책에서 배웠나요, 또는 다른 사람으로부터? 또는 학교에서 가르치는 것인가요?\nLT: 저를 위한 거의 모든 프로세스는 상당히 점진적이었고 학습하는 경험이었다는 것을 말하는 것으로 대답을 시작하겠습니다. 30년은 긴 시간이고, 무척 적은 변경들만이 매우 갑작스러운 것이었으며, 우리가 일을 하는 방식은 매우 \u0026ldquo;유기적인\u0026rdquo; 방식으로 성장했습니다.\n달리 말하자면, 미리 계획하고 관리 교과서 등을 읽는 것의 결과가 아니라는 겁니다. 대부분의 경우 그건 그 스스로 벌어졌고, 우리가 지금 가지고 있는 모든 구조는 어떤 조직도로부터 만들어진 게 아니라, 그저 사람들이 \u0026ldquo;각자의 자리를 찾은\u0026rdquo; 결과입니다.\n사람들이 어렵다고 생각하는 한가지 분명한 기술은 \u0026ldquo;제어를 놓는 것\u0026rdquo; 입니다. 저는 초창기에, 사람들이 제게 패치를 보내면 그걸 패치 그대로 적용하지 않고 그걸 읽고 사람들이 무얼 하고 싶은지 알아낸 후, 그걸 저 스스로 했던 걸 기억합니다. 제가 프로젝트를 그렇게 시작했고, 그걸 제가 더 편하게 느꼈으며, 그걸 통해 코드를 더 잘 알 수 있었으니까요.\n결국엔 그게 제게 있어 큰 문제가 아닌 걸로 드러났습니다. 전 꽤 빨리 그러는 걸 그만뒀는데, 그저 제가 게으르기 때문입니다. 전 패치를 읽고 그 사람이 뭘 한 건지 잘 이해할 수 있게 되었고, 그 후부터는 그 패치들을 그대로 적용했습니다. 그러니 제가 제어에 집작하던 날들은 꽤 금방 끝났습니다. 제 생각에 저는 믿을 만한 사람을 찾는걸 잘했고, 그 후로는 그냥 그렇게 했습니다 - 그들을 믿고, 지나친 마이크로매니징은 하지 않기.\n그러니 권한 넘기기는 제게는 큰 문제가 아니었습니다만, 다른 몇몇 프로젝트들에는 그랬음을 알고 있습니다. 다시 말하지만, 이건 부분적으로는, 우리의 메인테이너쉽 모델이 절대적인 믿음을 요구하지 않는, 덕분에 모든 일을 훨씬 쉽게 만들어주는 것이기 때문입니다.\n대화 기술은 무척 많이 중요합니다. 저는 저널리스트 가족 출신이며 (제 부모님 두분 모두 저널리스트였고, 제 삼촌도 그렇고, 제 증조부는 시인 겸 저널리스트였습니다), 덕분에 매우 어릴 때부터 읽기와 쓰기가 상당히 당연하게 여겨지는 집에서 자랐습니다. 영어는 제 세번째 언어지만 제가 리눅스 개발을 시작했을 때는 이미 익숙했고, 따라서 소통이 큰 문제는 아니었습니다. 하지만 이게 개인적 (어쩌면 성격) 이유로도 언어 장벽 이유로도 큰 문제가 될 수 있음을 알고 있습니다.\n하지만 일반적으로, 대부분의 것은 저는 직접 하면서 배웠습니다. 다시 말하지만, 기억해 주세요 - 리눅스의 어떤 것도 하룻밤에 이뤄지지 않았습니다. 30년 전의 그 프로젝트는 오늘날의 모습과 무척 달랐습니다.\nJA: 오픈소스가 상당히 성공적인 것이 되었지만, 가장 큰 유저들 가운데 다수, 예를 들어 회사들은, 그들이 의존하고 있는 그 오픈소스 프로젝트에 기여를 하거나 지원을 하는 일을 하지 않거나 아주 조금만 합니다. 사용자 수로만 따지면 놀랍도록 크고 성공적인 프로젝트의 개발자들조차 일주일치 커피를 사기 위한 돈을 버는게 행운인 경우가 있습니다. 이게 해결 가능할까요? 오픈소스 모델은 지속 가능합니까?\nLT: 전 이에 대한 답을 갖고 있지 않습니다, 그리고 어떤 이유로든 커널은 이 문제를 겪지 않았습니다. 그래요, 리눅스의 순수한 \u0026ldquo;사용자\u0026rdquo; 인 회사들이 있습니다만 그들도 결국은 지원을 받고 싶어하고, 따라서 계약자나 리눅스 배포판에 의존하게 되어서 이는 분명 결과적으로 커널 개발자 일자리의 큰 원천이 됩니다.\n그리고 커널을 사용하는 거대 기술 기업 중 다수가 종종 개발 프로세스에 적극적으로 참여하게 됩니다. 어떤 경우에는 그들은 내부 작업을 더 많이 하게 되고 그것들을 업스트림으로 도로 기여하는데 썩 열심이진 않습니다 (그 이름들을 거론하진 않겠습니다, 그리고 그 중 몇몇은 그걸 개선하려 정말 열심히 노력하고 있어요), 하지만 얼마나 많은 대기업이 업스트림 커널 개발에 개방적으로 참여하고 있는지, 그리고 커뮤니티의 중요한 부분인지에 대한 결과적 사실은 실로 고무적입니다.\n그러므로 어떤 이유로든, 커널 개발 커뮤니티는 모든 상업적 관심들과 통합되는데 상당히 성공적이었습니다. 물론, 그 중 일부는 매우 의도적인 것이었습니다: 리눅스는 거의 항상 상업적 사용자에게 열려 있었고, 전 의도적으로 \u0026ldquo;자유 소프트웨어 (역자 주: Free Software)\u0026rdquo; 그룹의 극단적 형태의 일부로부터 분명 찾을 수 있는 그 모든 상업성 반대적 사고방식을 피했고, 저는 - 그리고 리눅스는 - \u0026ldquo;오픈소스\u0026rdquo; 로의 브랜드 교체의 큰 부분을 차지했습니다.\n왜냐하면 솔직하게 말해서, rms (역자 주: 리처드 스톨먼) 와 FSF 의 거의 종교적인 분위기 중 일부는 그저 어리석은 것이었고 그 커뮤니티의 일부는 적극적으로 상업적 이용을 못하게 하려 했습니다.\n그리고 전 그걸 상업적 관심에 의해 더럽혀지는 걸 항상 걱정하는 누군가라고 부릅니다. 예를 들면 저는 한 리눅스 회사를 위해 일하고 싶지 않다고 의식적으로 생각했습니다. 저는 첫 10년간은 리눅스 관리를 직업으로써 하지 않았습니다. 그건 제가 상업적 관심이 잘못되었다고 생각해서가 아니라, 사람들이 저를 분명한 중립적 관계자라고 여기지, \u0026ldquo;경쟁자\u0026rdquo; 라고 느끼지 않을 수 있도록 하기 위함이었습니다.\n하지만 일부 프로젝트는 지나치게 상업 반대 성향을 가짐으로써, 그리고 회사들이 참여하기 어렵게 함으로써 자기 발등에 총을 쐈다고 생각합니다.\n그리고, 회사와 일하는게 항상 쉽지는 않습니다. 회사에 오픈소스와 일을 어떻게 해야 하는지 가르치는 걸 도우려 노력하는데 무척 적극적인 몇몇 커널 메인테이너들이 있습니다: 그건 리눅스 재단이 하는 일 가운데 하나이고 (기술적 분야에서만이 아니구요: 법적 문제 등을 위한 수업도 있습니다), 주요 커널 메인테이너 가운데에서는 Greg KH 가 그 쪽으로 무척 적극적입니다. 그러니 노력이 좀 들어갑니다.\n하지만 그게 지속 가능하냐구요? 그렇습니다. 저는 개인적으로 오픈소스가 지속가능할 뿐만 아니라 복잡한 기술 문제는 그 문제가 하나의 단일 회사에서 관리하기에는, 심지어 거대하고 능력 있는 기술 회사라 할지라도, 지나치게 복잡하게 되기 때문에 결국은 오픈소스가 여러분에게 정말 필요하게 됨을 100% 믿고 만족하고 있습니다.\n하지만 이는 양쪽 모두에 상당한 개방성을 필요로 합니다. 모든 회사가 좋은 파트너가 되지는 않을 겁니다, 그리고 일부 개발자는 대기업과 일하고 싶어하지 않을 수도 있습니다.\nJA: 장기간 일한 오픈소스 메인테이너들과 대화하며 우리가 발견한 공통적 주제는 번아웃으로, 부분적으로는 프로젝트를 매우 공개적으로 유지하는데 대한 변함없는 압력, 그리고 자기가 무언가를 빚쟁이라도 되는듯 요청을 해대는 사용자들 때문입니다. 당신도 이걸 경험하셨나요? 어떻게 이걸 처리하고, 어떻게 번아웃을 피하시나요? 커널 개발을 그만두는 걸 고려해 본 적이 있습니까?\nLT: 글쎄요, 앞의 \u0026ldquo;핵심 교훈들\u0026rdquo; 질문에서 이 문제를 넌지시 이야기 한 것 같은데요.\n왜냐하면, 그래요, 그런 압박이 있습니다. 그리고, 예, 저 또한 진저리를 친 적이 있습니다.\n동시에, 저 개인적으로는, 저의 \u0026ldquo;됐어, 이걸로 충분해\u0026rdquo; 발작은 \u0026ldquo;오늘은 이걸로 충분해\u0026rdquo; 를 의미하는데 훨씬 가깝습니다. 저도 스트레스를 받고, 짜증이 날 때가 있습니다. 전 분명 사람들 앞에서 몇번 폭발했고, 그때는 흉했습니다 (그리고 저는 그런 일이 재발되지 않도록 하기 위해 적극적으로 노력해오고 있습니다). 여러분은 제가 무언가나 누군가를 모욕하는 걸 그만두는 건 분명 보지 못할 겁니다.\n하지만.\n전 자리에서 일어나고, 책을 읽고, 바깥 날씨가 좋으면 드라이브를 잠깐 하기도 하고, 휴식을 취합니다. 그러면 전 거기서 극복됩니다. 그리고 다음날 복귀하는데, 결국 저는 제가 하고 있는 걸 정말 즐기기 때문입니다. 커널 개발을 하지 않으면 매일을 눈물로 지새울 겁니다.\n그러므로 휴가를 갈 때에도 (전 일년에 두번 스쿠버 다이빙을 합니다, 판데믹 덕에 작년엔 그러지 못했지만요) 저는 제가 개발을 계속할 수 있도록 랩탑을 챙깁니다. 제가 평소만큼 즉각적으로 응답하지 않을 것을 사람들에게 알리지만 개발 기간 내에 일을 끝마칠 수 있는 한은 그건 일반적으로 큰 문제가 되지 않습니다. 정전된 환경에 놓이는 경우는 제게 매우 드뭅니다, 그게 몇번 일어난 적 있긴 하지만 말이죠 (다시 말하지만 - 가끔 스쿠버 다이빙을 하는 건 오늘날에도 \u0026ldquo;인터넷 없는 진귀한 곳\u0026rdquo; 을 의미합니다), 때문에 저는 몇번 그로 인해 일주일 가량 연락이 끊긴 적 있습니다.\n그리고 전 해외에 머무는 것, 일주일간 하루에 다섯번씩 다이빙 하는 것, 그리고 말 그대로 이메일을 읽을 수조차 없는 걸 정말 좋아합니다. 지난 5년간 이걸 세번 했습니다, 아마도요. 멋진 시간이었어요.\n하지만 그러고 나선 복귀합니다, 그리고 복귀하는 것도 정말 행복합니다.\nJA: 30년은 긴 시간입니다, 그리고 미래를 예측하는 건 불가능하단 걸 저도 알지만 이 질문을 하고 싶군요: 다음 30년동안 리눅스는 어떻게 될까요? 그리고 그 동안 당신의 역할은 무엇이 될거라 생각하나요?\nLT: 이건 제가 답변할 수 없는 질문인데, 제가 이걸 회피하려 해서가 아니라 그건 제가 일하는 방법, 제가 프로젝트를 생각하는 방법이 아니기 때문입니다.\n전 \u0026ldquo;30년 계획\u0026rdquo; 이 없습니다. 5년짜리 계획조차 없어요. 사실, 저는 한두개 릴리즈 (겨우 수개월) 이상은 계획하지 않아요.\n엔지니어로써, 저는 \u0026ldquo;세부사항이 중요하다\u0026rdquo; 는 강한 의견을 갖고 있습니다. 세부사항이 중요한 거의 유일한 것입니다. 세부사항을 옳게 했다면, 나머지는 따라올 겁니다.\n이게 좀 이상하게 들릴 수 있을 겁니다, 제가 이미 \u0026ldquo;좋은 취향\u0026rdquo; 에 대해 이야기 한 사실을, 그리고 제가 유닉스 철학 (\u0026ldquo;모든 것은 파일이다\u0026rdquo; 가 핵심 원칙 중 하나죠) 이 옳다고 이야기하는 게 기록되어 있음을 생각해 보면 말이죠.\n그리고 Git 의 경우, 저는 전반적인 \u0026ldquo;설계\u0026rdquo; 역시 원했고, Git 에는 모든 것에 앞서는 큰 컨셉 몇가지 (\u0026ldquo;모든 것은 변형 불가한 객체다\u0026rdquo; 가 Unix 의 것과 같은 Git 의 것일 겁니다) 가 존재합니다.\n하지만 그런 \u0026ldquo;높은 수준의 설계\u0026rdquo; 같은 건 주로 결속력 있는 결과 같은 걸 위해, 그리고 커뮤니티에 일종의 \u0026ldquo;설계 방향 지침\u0026rdquo; 을 위해 필요합니다. 그게 결과적으로 가장 중요한 것은 아닙니다. 현실은 복잡하고 때로는 추합니다, 그리고 그런 높은 수준의 큰 설계는 세부 사항, 그리고 현실에서는 실제로 필요하게 될 모든 특수한 경우들을 담지 못합니다.\n그래서 저는 제가 \u0026ldquo;꾸준히 일하는 엔지니어\u0026rdquo; 라고 이야기 하길 좋아합니다. 전 지금 무슨 일이 일어나는지 보고, 우리가 지금 가진 문제를 보고, \u0026ldquo;내가 그 결과를 관리해야만 한다\u0026rdquo; 를 아는 것 외의 어떤 미래도 계획하지 않으며, 우리가 오늘 하는 일이 내일 큰 문제가 되지 않음을 분명히 하기를 원합니다.\n이게 당신의 질문의 마지막 부분에 일종의 답이 될 겁니다: 전 제가 계속 거기 있을 거라 생각합니다. 다음 30년동안 계속은 아니겠지만, 전 제가 하는 일을 즐기고, 제가 프로젝트에 실제 도움이 된다고 느끼는 동안은 계속 거기 있을 겁니다.\nJA: 자신의 오픈소스 개발 작업을 지원할 돈이 늘어나기를 원하는 개발자를 위한 조언이 있습니까?\nLT: 이건 제가 정말로 아무런 답도 갖고 있지 않은 첫번째 질문이군요.\n전 리눅스를 긴 시간동안 지속될 순수한 취미라고, 그게 진짜 제 직업이 될거라고는 전혀 생각하지 않고 시작했습니다. 제 첫번째 (처음 몇년은 일했던 학계가 아닌) 업계에서의 직업은 리눅스와 연관되지 않은 것이었고, 전 제 계약서가 제 리눅스 관련 작업은 회사의 일이 아님을 명시하게 했습니다 (Transmeta 가 - 역자 주: Transmeta 는 리누스 토발즈가 처음 일했던 회사입니다 - 리눅스를 사용하긴 했지만 그건 제 진짜 일이 아니었습니다, Transmeta 가 내부적으로 가지고 있는 리눅스 문제 - 주로 초기의 SMP 문제 - 를 제가 해결하게 된다고 해도 말이죠).\n사실, 리눅스 2.6 릴리즈를 위해 (좋아요, 분명한 버전이 뭐였는지 지금은 솔직히 확신이 들지 않는군요, 그건 오래전 일이예요. 그건 2.5.x 로 스트레스 받던 시절의, 그리고 제가 2.6 릴리즈를 위해 전업으로 집중할 필요가 있다고 느꼈던 때라고 생각합니다) Transmeta 에 무급 휴가를 신청할 계획을 세웠을 정도로 제게 있어 리눅스는 일이 아닌 것에 가까웠습니다. 그때 OSDL (\u0026ldquo;Open Source Development Labs\u0026rdquo; - 나중에 리눅스 재단이 되었죠) 이 나타나서 제가 상업적 리눅스 회사를 위해 일하지 않고도 실질적으로 리눅스 작업을 위해 돈을 받을 수 있게 되었죠.\n그러니 리눅스 개발의 첫 10년간은 돈을 더 버는 것 같은 것은 제게 있어 문제로 여겨지지 않았습니다 - 전 그걸 다른 측면에서 했습니다. 그리고 그 10년간 그렇게 일한 후, 제가 그걸 전업으로 해야 할 것 같다고 느꼈을 때에는, \u0026ldquo;그냥 그렇게 되었을\u0026rdquo; 정도로 리눅스가 이미 중요해 졌습니다.\n하지만 전 이게 정말 정말 평범하지 않은 경우임을 알고 있고, 당신의 질문에 대한 일반적 경우를 위한 답은 정말 갖고 있지 않습니다.\n그러니까, 그 답이 정확히 \u0026ldquo;10년간은 그걸 취미로 계획하고, 그게 더이상 취미일 수 없을 정도로 성장하면, 당신은 이미 후원 문제를 해결했을 겁니다\u0026rdquo; 가 아니라면 말이죠.\n주의 바랍니다! 여기가 핀란드에서 자랐다는 사실이 제게 있어 얼마나 행운이었는지 이야기 하고 싶은 지점입니다. 세계 최고 수준에 완전히 무료인 교육 시스템 하에서, 저는 리눅스를 취미로 여기는게, 그리고 제가 상업적 소프트웨어 개발자로써 돈을 벌 수 있음을 아는게 완전히 말이 되는 배경 하에서 자랐습니다. 저는 대략 7000 달러의 - 첨단 기술의 세계에서는 걱정할 가치가 있지는 않은 - 학비 지원 같은 걸 받고 8년간 세계에서 손꼽히는 수준의 대학교에서 공부를 했습니다.\n미국의 많은 사람들이 그게 삶에 주는 자유에 대해 정말로 이해하지 못함을 저는 실로 깨달았습니다. 정말 여러분이 좋아하는 일을 고를 수 있게 됩니다, 왜냐면 여러분이 그 비용을 지불할 수 있으니까요.\nThe Linux Foundation JA: 리눅스 재단의 생성에 당신은 얼마나 관여했나요? 당신의 역할은 무엇입니까? 당신이 상업적 리눅스 회사를 위해 일하지 않고도 급여를 받을 수 있게 하는 것 외에 그 재단이 커널에 영향을 끼쳤나요?\nLT: 전 OSDL (나중에 리눅스 재단이 되었죠) 의 생성에 아무런 일도 하지 않았습니다. 전 말 그대로 그저 직원입니다, \u0026ldquo;펠로우\u0026rdquo; 라는 남의 시선을 끄는 타이틀을 가지고 있긴 하지만요.\nOSDL 은 회사들이 일을 함께 하는 걸 위한, - 특히 엔터프라이즈적 가능성에의 협력을 위한 - 그리고 개발자들이 사용 가능한 기계들을 (예를 들어 개발자들이 접근 권한을 갖지 않고는 사용할 수 없는 종류의 하드웨어) 갖추는 걸 중시하는 비영리 업계 협회로 시작되었습니다. 이 모든게 제가 그들에게 고용되기 전에 시작되었고 그 모든게 저와 연관 없이 일어났습니다.\n그러고 나서 OSDL 이 또다른 비영리 업계 협회인 Free Standard Group 과 병합되면서 리눅스 재단이 되었습니다. 하드웨어 지원쪽 일은 곁가지가 되었고, \u0026ldquo;업계 협회\u0026rdquo; 부분이 주요한 일이 되었습니다. 다시 말하지만, 그러고 나서 제가 그들에게 고용되었긴 하지만, 이건 제가 개인적으로 속한 무언가가 아니었습니다: 저는 의도적으로 기술적 커널 개발 측면에만 집중해 있기를 유지했습니다.\nLF (역자 주: 리눅스 재단 - Linux Foundation) 는 저와 Greg KH 같은 일부 핵심 개발자들을 지원하는 것 외에도 많은 일을 하고 있습니다. 사실, 여러분이 LF 웹사이트 (또는 위키피디아 페이지) 에서 찾아보는게 정말 나을 정도로 LF 는 많은 일을 하고 있습니다. LF 는 다양한 종류의 인프라 관련 일을 하고 있습니다: 어떤건 기술적입니다만 (kernel.org 같은), 다른 \u0026ldquo;지원\u0026rdquo; 쪽 일도 많습니다 - 컨퍼런스를 조직하고, 업계 파트너들을 위한 실무 그룹을 만들고, 등등.\n그러니까, LF 는 기본적으로 인프라와 리눅스를 둘러싼 다양한 것을 위한 많은 프로젝트들을 지원합니다. 그리고 저는 그저 기본적으로 제가 하는 모든 일은 오픈소스가 되어야 한다는, 그리고 LF 는 제게 리눅스를 가지고 뭘 해야 한다고 할 수 없는, 상당히 특수한 고용 계약을 가진 직원일 뿐입니다. 전 행복하고, 재단의 멤버인 회사들도 행복한 듯 보이는데, 그들 모두가 전 어떤 회사 정책에도 정말로 속박되지 않음을 알고 있기 때문입니다.\nOther Interests JA: 무엇이 당신을 미국으로 이끌었나요? 핀란드를 그리워하거나 그리로 돌아가는 걸, 또는 다른 나라로 이주하는 걸 고려해 봤나요?\nLT: 전 97년에 미국으로 이사왔는데 부분적으로는 제가 상당히 젊었고 제가 무척 익숙한 영역에서 (예를 들어 평범하지 않은 80386 아키텍쳐 - 그걸 뜯어보는게 리눅스가 시작된 목적이었죠) 매우 흥미로운 일을 하는 스타트업으로부터 고용 제안을 받았기 때문이었습니다.\n그리고 당시 핀란드는 상당한 기술 강국이었지만 휴대전화 위주였습니다 (노키아는 핀란드 기업이고 당시에는 세계에서 가장 큰 휴대전화 회사였고 매우 큰 점유율을 가진 핀란드 최대 기업이었습니다).\n전 전화기에 관심이 없었습니다 (이건 그게 성장해서 작은 컴퓨터가 되기 전의 일입니다 - 여러분이 믿을지 모르겠지만 사람들은 실제로 그걸 다른 사람들과 대화하기 위해 사용했습니다). 그리고 미국은 흥미로워 보였고, 저는 제 부인과 우리의 (당시에) 태어난 지 10주 된 첫째 딸을 데리고 여기로 이사 왔습니다.\n첫 아이가 생겼을 때, 그리고 도와줄 다른 가족이 없는데 다른 나라로 이사하는 것은 가장 현명한 일은 아마 아닐 겁니다. 하지만 봐요, 우린 젋었고, \u0026ldquo;시도해보자\u0026rdquo; 전략을 취했으며, 그게 모두 잘 통했습니다. 우리가 2월에 어떻게 이사했는지, 그리고 우리가 떠나던 때의 헬싱키는 추웠던 것 (섭씨 -20도, 그러니까 화씨로 대략 0도였습니다), 샌프란시스코 공항에 도착해 비행기에서 내렸을 때에는 맑고 향기로운 화씨 70도였던 걸 (역자 주: 섭씨로 대략 20도) 아직도 기억합니다.\n흥미로운 일입니다. 미국은 지금은 제 집이 있는 나라입니다, 그리고, 그래요, 전 핀란드의 어떤 부분들은 그리워 합니다. 미국의 교육 시스템은 재앙입니다. 좋은 학교를 위해선 올바른 지역으로 이사를 해야만 하고, 좋은 대학을 위해선 말도 안되게 비싼 학비를 지불해야 합니다. 이건 부끄러운 일입니다. 건강 보험 시스템도 마찬가지입니다. 그리고 미국의 정치적 분위기는 \u0026ldquo;약간 이상함\u0026rdquo; 에서 완전히 공포스러움으로 변했습니다. 핀란드에서는요? 대부분 잘 작동합니다.\n하지만 보세요, 장점들도 있는데, 그건 날씨만이 아닙니다 (그래요, 우린 그 후에 오레곤 포틀랜드로 이사했고 여기 날씨는 Bay Area 만큼 좋지는 않죠, 하지만 절 믿으세요 - 핀란드보다는 여기 날씨가 여전히 훨씬 나아요). 그리고 우린 우리 아이들이 핀란드 말을 못할 정도로 여기서 오래 살았고 (저와 제 부인 둘 다 스웨덴 말을 사용하는 핀란드의 소수 집단 출신이라, 집에서는 스웨덴 말을 씁니다), 미국에 친구들이 있고 사회적으로 묶여 있습니다. 그리고 좋은 직업을 가지고 있다면 미국 사회의 문제들을 대다수 무시할 수 있습니다.\n우리가 핀란드로 돌아가는 걸 고려해 봤느냐구요? 몇번요. 처음은 아이들이 학교를 다니기 시작했을 때입니다. 고등학교를 다니기 시작했을 때도 그랬구요. 대학교에 갈때도 그랬습니다. 어떤 패턴이 보이나요? 그리고 트럼프가 재당선 될 수도 있을 것 같아 보였을 때 또 고려했습니다.\nJA: 세계의 많은 사람들이 그 선거에 주의를 기울였고, 그게 어떤 의미가 될지 걱정했죠. 그리고 지금조차도, 칠천만의 미국인이 그의 재당선을 지지했음을 생각할 때, 미래에 대한 어떤 전조가 보입니다. 트럼프의 재당선을 지지하는 사람들과의 대화는 어떻게 하시나요?\nLT: 일반적으로 미국의 정치 시스템은 절 근심하게 만들고, 미국의 예외주의와 민족주의는 슬프고 공포스럽습니다. 특히 그게 자신들이 무슨 말을 하고 있는지 말그대로 전혀 이해하지 못하고 다른 나라에 살아본 적도 없는 사람들에 의해 행해질 때에요.\n미국은 여러 측면에서 멋진 나라이고 많은 문화와 사람들로 (그리고 자연으로) 가득한, 다양성이 풍부한 나라이며 전 그걸 좋아합니다. 사실 이게 제가 핀란드로 돌아가기를 가장 힘들게 하는 부분일 겁니다 - 핀란드는 매우 친절하고, 이성적이고 안전한 나라지만 매우 작고 매우 단일한 곳입니다.\n하지만 교육받지 않은, 그 \u0026ldquo;랄라, 아메리카 넘버원!\u0026rdquo; 류의 것들은 매우 짜증나기도 합니다. 여러분은 아메리카 깃발로 가득한 트럭들을 볼 것이고, 종종 부끄러움에 얼굴을 감싸게 될겁니다.\n그리고 가끔은 교육받은 사람들조차 그럽니다. 트럼프가 당선되기 전, 저는 무척 친절한 의사와 이야기한 적 있는데, 그는 미국 건강 보험 체계가 세계 최고라고 절대적으로 믿고 있었습니다. 그는 다른 나라에서 살아본 적 없으면서 그렇게 생각했고, 때문에 다른 나라가 실제로 더 나은 건강 보험 체계를 가지고 있을 거라 인정할 수 없었을 겁니다 - 그 더 나은 건강보험 체계를 실제로 목격한 누군가와 토론하면서도 말이죠. 그는 의대에서 수년의 세월을 보낸, 상당히 교육된 사람인데도 그 \u0026ldquo;아메리카, x나 좋군!\u0026rdquo; 정신상태를 가지고 있었습니다.\n그리고 맞아요, 그는 트럼프 지지자였습니다.\n제 말을 오해하지 마세요 - 민족주의는 유럽을 포함해 어디에나 존재합니다. 핀란드조차도 예외가 아닙니다. 하지만 그것의 미국 버전은 무척 독소로 가득해 보입니다.\n그리고 솔직히, 그게 제가 서부 해안에 사는 이유 중 하나입니다. 오레곤은 대부분 무척 진보적인데 적어도 모든 인구 밀집 지역에서는 그렇습니다 (동부 오레곤은 무척 다릅니다만, 거기에 정말로 살기는 거의 누구에게나 어려울 겁니다 - 영역은 넓은데 매우 적은 인구만이 거기 삽니다). 그러니 제가 사는 곳에서는 남부연합 깃발 (또는 트럼프 깃발) 을 잘 보기 어렵습니다, 어디선가 큰 트럭을 탄 사람이 때때로 나타나긴 하지만 말이죠.\n하지만, 전 미국이 정말 변화하고 있다고 생각합니다. 우린 이제 여기서 거의 25년간 살아왔고, 그 동안에만도 변화가 있었다고 느낍니다. 광적인 신앙심은 사라지고 있습니다, 이것도 어디 사는가에 무척 연관된 문제지만 말이죠. 그리고 여러 측면에서 미국은 분명 사회 억압적 정책을 해결하려 노력했습니다 (예를 들어 동성애자 결혼 합법화, 마약류와의 전쟁의 실질적인 종료 등등). 그러므로 전체적으로 저는 꽤 낙관적이고 트럼프 현상은 필경 (바라건대) 그 전체적인 긍정적 변화의 결과일 뿐이라 생각합니다. 고전적인 반동적 보수화죠.\nJA: 리눅스 커널 외에 어떤 흥미와 취미를 가지고 있나요? 커널 개발에 집중하고 있지 않을 때에는 뭘 합니까?\nLT: 이미 몇번 그 주요한 두가지를 이야기 했습니다: 전 독서를 많이 하고 (진지한 것 말고 판타지나 공상과학류를 아무거나 골라서 제 킨들에서 읽는 경향이 있습니다), 여행을 할때는 가능하면 스쿠버 다이빙을 하려 노력합니다.\n그리고 전 정말 평범한 가족적 삶을 유지합니다. 전 세 딸이 있지만 모두 충분히 자랐고 거의 독립했습니다. 막내는 여전히 대학교를 다니고 있고 여름에는 집에 올겁니다. 둘째는 대학원을 다니고 있고 여름에도 집에 오진 않을 겁니다. 첫째는 이 나라의 반대편 (역자 주: 미국 동부가 되겠네요) 에서 일을 하고 있습니다. 우린 여전히 가족 휴가를 가지려 노력합니다만 (하지만 둘째만 스쿠버 다이빙 자격증을 땄어요 - 모두 그러도록 노력했지만, 현재로썬 그렇습니다), 작년은 정말 좋지 못했죠.\n그러니 요즘은, 주로 저와 제 부인과 우리의 두 반려견들, 그리고 반려묘 한마리와 살고 있습니다. 전 제 첫번째 백신 접종을 받았고 몇달 내로 약간은 더 평범한 삶으로 돌아갈 수 있기를 기다리고 있습니다.\nJA: 항상 새로운 책을 찾는 한명의 열렬한 공상과학 소설 독자로써, 저는 당신이 다른 것들보다 더 즐기는 작가나 시리즈가 있는지 궁금하군요. 당신이 여전히 때때로 생각하는, 언급할만한 좋은 책들이 있을까요?\nLT: 솔직히, 저는 \u0026ldquo;읽고는 잊어버리는\u0026rdquo; 종류의 사람입니다 - 전 대부분 금방 기억에서 잊혀질, 나중에도 생각하게 되지는 않을게 분명한 것들을 무작위로 읽습니다. Lios McMaster Bujold 의 Miles Vorkosigan 시리즈 같은 것들은 제 기준으로 교양서 수준의 것입니다 - 전 작가에 관계 없이 공짜 또는 99센트짜리 킨들 공상과학과 판타지 소설들을 읽었던 것 같습니다. 대부분 판타지 소설이었는데, 찾기 쉬운 게 주요한 이유였습니다 (그리고 저는 나쁜 판타지 소설보다 나쁜 공상과학소설에 더 짜증납니다).\n\u0026ldquo;쓰레기는 아닌\u0026rdquo; 부류의 판타지 소설 쪽에는 Brandon Sanderson 과, 어쩌면 Robin Hobb 이 있다고 생각합니다. 하지만 Sanderson 의 작품에는 대략 50개는 되는, 금방 기억에서 잊혀질 법한 아무런 검과 마법 이야기가 있죠.\n제가 다시 손에 집어드는 것들도 몇개 있는데, 저는 Dune saga 를 10년에 한번씩은 다시 읽는 것 같습니다. 그건 시간이 지나도 여전하고 세월을 잘 버텨낸 (매우 희귀한) 것 중 하나입니다. 10대였을 때에는 Heinlein 을 좋아했습니다만 지금은 싫증났습니다.\n그러니, 제게서 읽을 것에 대한 단서를 구하지 마세요. 제게 있어, 독서는 휴식을 위한 것이지 지식을 위한 것이나 매우 진지한 것이 아닙니다.\nJA: 예전에 하신, 당신의 다이빙에 대한 배경을 설명한 이 인터뷰 가 흥미로웠습니다. 여전히 당신이 시작한 다이빙 기록 프로그램인 Subsurface 를 사용하고 거기에 기여하시나요?\nLT: 여전히 사용합니다, 작년엔 분명한 이유로 그걸 사용하지 못했지만요. Subsurface 는 제가 만들고 싶어서가 아니라 필요로 인해 만들었다는 점에서 Git 과 약간 비슷합니다. 그리고 Git 처럼, 전 그걸 위한 메인테이너를 구했고, 지금은 Dirk Hohndel 이 오랫동안 그걸 유지보수해 왔으며 저만을 위한 것보다 훨씬 더한 무언가로 만들었습니다 (처음에는 리눅스만 지원했는데 윈도우즈, MacOS, iOS 그리고 안드로이드도 지원하게 만들었죠).\n그리고 다이빙 없이는 그걸 위한 작업을 할 동기가 없습니다, 보고된 문제 일부를 고치는 걸 작년에 돕긴 했지만요.\n제 두번째 백신 접종은 2주 뒤이고, 몇달 내로 다이빙을 다시 할겁니다. 그러니 그게 제가 문제들 몇개를 더 고치게 만들겠군요.\nJA: 감사합니다. 제 커리어 전체는 당신의 \u0026ldquo;취미\u0026rdquo; 에서 성장했습니다, 직접적으로는 리눅스의 사용을 통해, 그리고 간접적으로는 리눅스와 Git 으로 인해 존재하게 된 셀 수 없이 많은 다른 프로젝트를 통해서 말이죠. 이 인터뷰를 통해 당신은 여전히 당신이 하는 일을 사랑하고 있음을 알게 되어 다행입니다. 당신이 완전한 백신 접종을 곧 마칠 거라니 기쁩니다. 그리고 이 모든 질문들에 상세하고 통찰력 있는 답변들을 위해 당신의 많은 시간을 공유해 준 데 대해 진심으로 감사합니다! 다시 말하지만, 감사합니다!\n첫번째 파트의 번역은 여기서 보실 수 있습니다.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/torvalds_interview_for_30th_anniversary_of_linux_kernel_part2/","summary":"리눅스 커널이 처음 공개된지 올해로 30년이 되었고, 이를 맞아 한 tag1 에서 리누스 토발즈와 인터뷰 를 했습니다. 분량이 많아 두 파트로 나눠 올렸는데요, 해당 매체에 허락을 받고 이곳에 그 중 두번째 파트의 번역을 올립니다.\n아래 분들께서 오타 등을 찾고 글을 다듬는 걸 도와주셨습니다. 감사의 말씀을 전합니다.\nJaehoon Kim Tag1 의 원본 글은 다음 링크에서 보실 수 있습니다: https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds-open-source-and-beyond-part-2\n첫번째 파트의 번역은 여기서 보실 수 있습니다.\n오픈소스 프로젝트의 관리 JA: 우린 최근에 Drupal 을 만든 Dries Buytaert 와 이야기 해봤는데, 그는 당신에게 받은 많은 영감과 가끔의 멘토링, 그리고 그가 지난 20년동안 그 유명한 Drupal CMS 를 관리하는 동안 받은 조언을 이야기하며 당신을 칭찬했습니다.","title":"리눅스 30주년 맞이 리누스 토발즈 인터뷰 번역 - 파트 2"},{"content":"리눅스 커널이 처음 공개된지 올해로 30년이 되었고, 이를 맞아 tag1 에서 리누스 토발즈와 인터뷰 를 했습니다: https://www.tag1consulting.com/blog/interview-linus-torvalds-linux-and-git 분량이 길어 두 파트로 나눠 올라왔는데, 해당 매체에 허락을 받고 이곳에 그 중 첫번째 파트의 번역을 올립니다.\n두번째 파트는 여기서 보실 수 있습니다.\n아래 분들께서 오타 등을 찾고 글을 다듬는 걸 도와주셨습니다. 감사의 말씀을 전합니다.\nganadist Jaehoon Kim 리눅스 커널 개발 Jeremy Andrews: 리눅스는 어디에나 사용되고 있고, 전체 오픈소스 세계에 영향을 끼쳤습니다. 물론, 처음부터 그런 건 아니었습니다. 당신은 comp.os.minix 의 Usenet 메일링 리스트에 겸손한 메일을 보냄으로써 1991년에 리눅스 커널을 릴리즈 했고 이는 무척 유명해졌죠. 10년 후, 당신은 그 역사를 이야기 하는\u0026quot;Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary\u0026quot; 라는 매력적이고도 개인적인 책을 냈습니다. 올해 8월, 리눅스는 30주년을 맞이하게 되었습니다! 대단해요, 축하합니다! 이 여정 가운데 언제쯤부터 당신은 리눅스가 \u0026ldquo;그저 취미 (just a hobby)\u0026rdquo; 보다는 더한 무엇이 되었음을 깨달았나요?\nLinus Torvalds: 좀 웃기게 들리겠지만, 그건 무척 초반부터였습니다. 이미 1991년 말부터 (그리고 1992년 초부터는 분명히) 리눅스는 이미 제가 예상한 것보다 훨씬 커져 있었습니다.\n그리고 그때 대략 수백명의 사용자가 있었는데 (\u0026ldquo;사용자\u0026rdquo; 라고 하는 것도 너무 어감이 강할지도요 - 사람들은 그걸 이리저리 뜯어보고 있었습니다), 리눅스가 나중에는 그보다 훨씬 거대해졌다는 점을 생각해 보면 이건 좀 이상하게 들릴 거예요. 하지만 제게 개인적으로는 다른 사람들이 활발하게 그걸 사용하고 있음을, 그리고 그것이 스스로의 삶을 시작했음을 깨달은 때가 여러 의미로 큰 변곡점이었습니다. 사람들은 패치를 보내기 시작했고, 시스템은 제가 처음에 상상했던 것보다 훨씬 많은 것들을 하기 시작했죠.\nX11 이 92년 4월에 리눅스로 포팅된 걸로 기억하는데 (날짜는 틀릴 수 있어요 - 그건 오~~래전 일이예요), 이는 GUI 와 모든 새로운 기능들이 가능하게 한, 또다른 큰 한걸음이었습니다.\n이 모든걸 놓고 보면 - 나는 높은 기대치의 큰 계획을 가지고 시작하지 않았습니다. 그건 새로운 운영체제를 만들어내기 위한 어떤 큰 꿈으로부터 시작된 게 아니라 말 그대로 그저 제 새 PC 하드웨어가 어떻게 작동하는지 알아보려 시작한데서 우발적으로 시작된 개인 프로젝트였습니다.\n그래서 제가 최초 버전을 릴리즈 했을 때, 그건 정말 \u0026ldquo;내가 뭘 만들었는지 보세요\u0026rdquo; 에 더 가까웠고, 다른 사람들이 거기에 흥미를 갖길 제가 원했던 건 분명하지만, 그건 정말 진지하고 사용할 수 있는 OS 는 아니었습니다. 그건 그보단 컨셉의 증명에 가까웠고 제가 몇달의 시간동안 일한 개인 프로젝트에 불과했습니다.\n그리고 그 \u0026ldquo;개인 프로젝트\u0026rdquo; 가 다른 사람들이 가져다 사용하고 피드백 (과 버그 레포트), 그리고 심지어 패치를 보내주는 것이 되어가는 과정은 제게 큰 변화였습니다.\n단지, 정말 기본적인 무언가 예를 들어 주기 위해서 사용한 리눅스 원래의 저작권 라이센스는 \u0026ldquo;당신은 이걸 소스 형태로 배포할 수 있습니다만, 상업적으로는 안됩니다\u0026rdquo; 같은 것이었습니다.\n왜냐하면 제게 있어 큰 문제들 중 하나는 말 그대로 상업용 유닉스는 비쌌다는 것이고 (글쎄요, 자기 돈을 모두 새로운 PC 사는데 쓴 가난한 학생에게는 말이죠), 때문에 제게 있어 (사람들이 그걸 고칠 수 있게끔) 소스코드가 사용 가능해야 한다는 건 크고 중요한 일 중 하나였습니다, 그리고 대안을 구매할 돈이 없는 바로 저같은 사람들에게 열려 있기를 바랬어요.\n그리고 전 그 라이센스를 91년 말 (또는 92년 초일지도) GPLv2 로 바꿨는데요, 그걸 지역 유닉스 사용자 그룹에 플로피 디스크를 사용해 배포하고자 하는데 최소한 그 플로피 디스크와 그 복사본을 만드는데 들인 시간을 보상받고 싶어하는 사람들이 있었기 때문입니다. 그리고 저는 그건 분명 완전 합리적인 일임을, 그리고 정말 중요한 건 \u0026ldquo;비상업성\u0026rdquo; 이 아니라 \u0026ldquo;소스코드는 개방되어야 한다\u0026rdquo; 는 부분임을 깨달았습니다.\n그 결과, 사람들은 그걸 유닉스 사용자 그룹 모임에 배포할 뿐만 아니라, SLS 와 Slackware 같은 플로피 디스크 기반 배포판들을 몇달만에 만들었습니다.\n초기의 정말 기본적인 변화들에 비교해서, 다른 모든 것은 \u0026ldquo;점진적\u0026rdquo; 이었습니다. 맞아요, 그런 점진적 변화 가운데 일부는 정말 거대했습니다 (IBM 이 참여하고, 오라클 DB 가 포팅되고, 레드햇이 상장하고, 안드로이드가 전화기 등에서 거대해지고), 하지만 그것들은 정말 초기의 \u0026ldquo;내가 알지도 못하는 사람들이 리눅스를 사용함\u0026rdquo; 에 비하면 제 개인적으로는 덜 혁명적이었어요.\nJA: 라이센스 선택에 대해, 또는 당신이 만든 것을 이용해 다른 사람이나 회사가 많은 돈을 벌어들이는 것에 대해 후회한 적은 없습니까?\nLT: 전혀요.\n일단, 전 꽤 잘 살고 있습니다. 전 미친듯한 부자는 아닙니다만, 좋은 보수를 받는 소프트웨어 엔지니어이고, 제가 좋아하는 걸 제 스스로의 스케쥴에 맞춰 하고 있습니다. 전혀 상처받지 않아요.\n하지만 이와 똑같이 중요한게, 그 라이센스가 리눅스 (그리고 Git) 의 성공의 큰 이유 중 하나였음에 100% 만족하고 있습니다. 저는 프로젝트에 참여하는 모두가 모든 사람이 동일한 권리를 가졌고, 누구도 라이센스에 관해선 특별하지 않음을 깨달을 때 훨씬 행복해진다고 생각합니다.\n원래 소유자가 상업성 라이센스를 소유하며 (\u0026ldquo;우리에게 라이센스 비용을 지불하면 당신은 이걸 당신의 독점 상품에 사용할 수 있습니다\u0026rdquo;), 다른 한편으로는 오픈소스의 경우엔 GPL 같은 무언가 하에 사용될 수도 있는 많은 수의 \u0026ldquo;듀얼 라이센스\u0026rdquo; 프로젝트들이 존재합니다.\n그리고 전 그런 종류의 상황 하에서는 커뮤니티를 만들기가 정말 어렵다고 생각하는데, 항상 오픈소스 쪽은 \u0026ldquo;두번째 클래스\u0026rdquo; 임을 알기 때문입니다. 또한 이는 특수한 집단이 항상 특수한 권리를 유지하기 위해 단순한 라이센스 서류 작업을 많이 해야 하게 합니다. 때문에 이는 프로젝트에 많은 마찰을 일으킵니다.\n다른 한편으로, 전 여러 BSD (또는 MIT 나 비슷한 것들) 라이센스를 사용하는 오픈소스 프로젝트들이 상업적으로 중요해질 만큼 거대해지는 순간 분열되고, 관련된 회사들이 자신들의 부분들을 독점화 하기로 결정해야만 하게 되는 것을 봤습니다.\n따라서 저는 GPLv2 가 \u0026ldquo;모두가 같은 규칙 아래 일한다\u0026rdquo;, 그리고 그 사람들은 커뮤니티에 얻은 것을 공헌한다 (\u0026ldquo;팃포탯\u0026rdquo;) 의 완벽한 밸런스라고 생각합니다. 그리고 모두가 참여자는 같은 규칙 아래 있음을 알게 되므로, 매우 공평하고 정당합니다.\n물론, 이것의 또다른 측면은 여러분 또한 공헌한 만큼 받아간다는 겁니다. 맞아요, 여러분은 프로젝트 변방에 머무르고 단순한 사용자가 될수도 있습니다, 그리고 그래도 되요. 하지만 그런다면, 여러분에겐 해당 프로젝트에 대한 제어권이 없습니다. 이것 역시 완전히 괜찮습니다, 여러분이 정말 기본적인 운영체제를 원할 뿐이라면 말이죠, 그리고 리눅스는 이미 여러분이 필요한 모든걸 하고 있습니다. 하지만 여러분에게 특수한 요구사항이 있다면, 프로젝트에 영향을 끼치는 유일한 방법은 참여하는 겁니다.\n이게 모두를 정직하게 만듭니다. 저를 포함해서요. 누구나 프로젝트를 포크 (fork) 해서 스스로의 방향으로 나아가고 \u0026ldquo;안녕히 리누스, 난 내 버전의 리눅스의 관리권을 가져갑니다\u0026rdquo; 라고 할 수 있습니다. 전 그저 사람들이 제가 일을 잘 할거라 믿기 때문에 - 그리고 그 믿음이 지속되는 동안만 - \u0026ldquo;특별\u0026rdquo; 합니다. 그리고 실로 그래야만 합니다.\n이 \u0026ldquo;누구나 스스로의 버전을 관리할 수 있다\u0026rdquo; 부분이 어떤 사람들을 GPLv2 에 대해 걱정하게 만듭니다, 하지만 전 그건 강점이지 약점이 아니라 생각해요. 어떤 면에선 의도된 바는 아니지만, 전 그게 리눅스의 파편화를 막아준 것이라고 생각합니다: 모두가 각자의 포크 (fork) 를 소유할 수 있고, 그래도 됩니다. 사실, 그건 \u0026ldquo;Git\u0026rdquo; 의 핵심 설계 철학 중 하나입니다 - 저장소의 모든 복사본은 그 자체로 작은 포크 (fork) 이고, 사람들 (그리고 회사들) 이 그들 스스로의 포크를 만드는 것이 바로 개발 이 이루어지는 과정입니다.\n그러므로 포크 (fork) 를 하는 건 문제가 아니예요, 그들로부터 좋은 부분들을 다시 머지할 수 있는 한 말이죠. 그리고 이게 GPLv2 가 해주는 일입니다. 포크하고 여러분 스스로의 일을 할 수 있는 권한을 갖는 건 중요합니다, 하지만 동전의 반대면도 똑같이 중요합니다 - 성공적이었다 여겨지는 포크를 다시 원본으로 병합 (merge) 할 수 있는 권리.\n또다른 문제는 여러분에게는 이 작업흐름을 지원하는 도구도 필요하지만, 이를 위한 마음가짐 또한 가져야만 한다는 점입니다. 포크를 원본으로 병합하는 경우의 큰 장애물에는 단순한 라이센스 문제 외에도 \u0026ldquo;나쁜 혈통\u0026rdquo; 이 있습니다. 어떤 포크가 적대적 이유로 시작되었다면, 두개의 포크를 하나로 합치는 건 무척 어려울 수 있습니다 - 라이센스나 기술적 이유가 아니라 그 포크가 무척 험악했기 때문에요. 다시 말하지만, 전 리눅스가 그걸 잘 피했으며, 이는 우리가 항상 포크 하는 행위를 자연적인 것이라 여겼고, 그럼 어떤 포크에서의 작업이 성공적이었다 여겨질 때 이를 원본에 도로 병합시키고자 하는 행위 역시 자연스러운 행위가 된다는 점 때문이 크다고 생각합니다.\n그러니까, 답변이 좀 옆길로 샜습니다만, 전 이게 중요한 점이라고 생각합니다 - 전 그 라이센스 선택을 전혀 후회하지 않아요, 왜냐하면 전 정말로 GPLv2 가 리눅스의 성공의 이유 중 큰 부분이라고 생각하거든요.\n돈은 정말 그렇게나 대단한 동기부여장치는 아닙니다. 그건 사람들을 끌어모으지 않아요. 공동의 프로젝트를 가지고 해당 프로젝트에 있어 여러분이 정말로 완전한 파트너가 될 수 있다고 정말로 느끼는 것, 그것이 사람들을 동기부여 시킵니다, 제 생각에는요.\nJA: 요즘 사람들이 소스코드를 GPLv2 아래 릴리즈 하면, 그건 보통 리눅스 때문입니다. 당신은 그 라이센스를 어떻게 발견했고, 다른 라이센스들을 검토해 보는데는 얼마나 많은 시간과 노력을 기울였나요?\nLT: 그당시, 사람들은 여전히 BSD vs GPL 에 대한 격렬하게 불타는 전쟁을 벌이고 있었습니다 (부분적으로는 rms 가 사람들을 욕하는데 가진 재능이 이를 부추겼다고 생각합니다), 따라서 저는 제가 구독중이던 일부 usenet 뉴스그룹을 통해 (comp.arch 나 comp.os.minix 등) 라이센스 토론 중 일부를 봤습니다.\n하지만 제가 GPLv2 를 선택한 두가지 주요 이유는 분명, 그저 gcc - 리눅스가 돌아가게 하는데 매우 주된 역할을 했습니다, 왜냐면 전 당연하게도 C 컴파일러가 필요했으니까요 - 와 제가 당시 다니던 대학교의 스웨덴말을 하는 (핀란드에서 스웨덴어는 작은 비주류층을 형성합니다) 컴퓨터학과 학생이었던 Lars Wirzenius (\u0026ldquo;Lasu\u0026rdquo;) 때문이었습니다.\nLasu 는 저보다 훨씬 더 라이센스 토론 등에 심취해 있었습니다.\n제게 있어, GPLv2 의 선택은 큰 정치적 문제가 아니었습니다, 그건 주로 제 원래 라이센스가 임시 변통의 것이고 업데이트되어야 할 필요가 있다는 것에 대한 것이었고, 전 gcc 에 신세를 졌을 뿐더러 GPLv2 는 저의 \u0026ldquo;당신은 소스코드를 되돌려줘야 합니다\u0026rdquo; 기대에 부합하는 것이었습니다.\n따라서 다른 라이센스를 만드는 것보다는 (또는 원래의 것을 수정하는 것 - 그저 \u0026ldquo;상업적으로 쓰이면 안됨\u0026rdquo; 부분만 제거하는 게 하나의 선택이 될 수 있었을 겁니다 - 보다는), 전 다른 사람들이 이미 알고 있는것을 고르고 일부 법률가들을 참여하게 하고 싶었습니다.\nJA: 당신의 평범한 하루는 어떻습니까? 얼마나 많은 시간을 코딩, 코드 리뷰, 이메일 읽고 쓰기에 사용하나요? 그리고 개인적 삶과 리눅스 커널을 위해 일하는 사이의 균형을 어떻게 잡습니까?\nLT: 요즘 저는 매우 적은 코드만을 작성합니다, 그런지 꽤 됐어요. 그리고 제가 코드를 작성하는 가장 흔한 상황은 어떤 특정한 문제에 대한 토론이 있을때 제가 제안하는 해결책을 설명하기 위함을 주목적으로 하는 패치를 만들어 보내는 때입니다.\n달리 말하면, 제가 작성하는 대부분의 코드는 \u0026ldquo;보세요, 이렇게 하면 어떨까요\u0026rdquo; 하는데 매우 구체적인 예를 드는 패치에 가깝습니다. 무언가를 어떻게 해결하는가에 대한 고수준의 이론적 토론에 빨려들어가기가 쉽습니다, 그리고 어떤 해결책을 설명하는 최선의 방법은 많은 경우 전체가 아니라 약간의 코드를 작성하고 그걸 구체적으로 만드는 것임을 알고 있습니다.\n저의 진짜 작업시간은 이메일을 읽고 쓰는데 쓰이기 때문입니다. 그건 대부분 소통을 하는 것이지, 코딩하는 게 아닙니다. 사실, 저는 지금과 같이 저널리스트나 기술 블로거들 등과 대화하는 종류의 것들을 말 그대로 제 업무시간의 한 부분으로 여깁니다 - 실제 기술적 토론에 비해 낮은 우선순위를 가질 수 있겠지만, 전 이런 종류의 일에도 적지 않은 시간을 사용합니다.\n그리고, 맞습니다, 전 코드리뷰에도 시간을 씁니다만, 솔직히 제가 풀리퀘스트를 받는 시점에서는 해당 코드는 일반적으로 이미 여러 사람들에게 리뷰가 되어 있어야 합니다. 따라서 저는 여전히 패치들을 들여다 보긴 합니다만, 실제로는 그 패치에 대한 설명과 그 패치가 어떻게 제게 오게 되었는지에 대한 과정을 더 보는 경향이 있습니다. 그리고 제가 오랫동안 함께 일한 사람들에 대해서는 그것조차 하지 않습니다: 그들은 그들의 서브시스템의 메인테이너이고, 전 그들의 일을 마이크로매니징 하기 위해 존재하지 않습니다.\n따라서 상당히 자주, 제 주된 일은 \u0026ldquo;거기 있는 것\u0026rdquo;, 취합 지점이 되는것, 그리고 릴리즈를 관리하고 강제하는 사람이 되는 것입니다. 달리 말하자면, 제 일은 일반적으로 낮은 수준의 코드보다는 관리 프로세스에 대한 것입니다.\nJA: 당신의 작업 환경은 어떤가요? 예를 들어, 방해 없는 어두운 방을, 아니면 경치가 좋은 방을 선호하나요? 주로 조용한 곳에서 일합니까, 아니면 음악을 들으며 일합니까? 어떤 하드웨어를 주로 사용하나요? 터미널에서 \u0026lsquo;vi\u0026rsquo; 를 사용해 코드리뷰를 하나요, 아니면 화려한 IDE 를 사용하나요? 그리고, 이 일을 위해 선호하는 리눅스 배포판이 있나요?\nLT: 제 방은 완전히 어둡지는 않습니다만 제 책상 옆 창문에 블라인드를 닫아두고는 있는데, 밝은 태양빛을 (오레곤의 이맘때에는 흔치 않지만요) 원치 않기 때문입니다. 그러니 경치는 없어요, 그저 (혼잡한) 책상과 두개의 4k 모니터 그리고 책상 아래 고성능 데스크탑 컴퓨터 만 있습니다. 그리고 제가 밖에 있을 때 테스트를 하기 위해 두개의 랩탑이 있습니다.\n그리고 저는 조용한데서 일하길 바랍니다. 전 기계식 디스크 드라이브의 - 지금으로부터 10년도 전에 SSD 만을 사용했기에 행복하게도 쓰레기통에 버렸죠 - 소음을 싫어해왔고 시끄러운 CPU fan 도 받아들일 수 없어요.\n그리고 모든 일은 전통적인 터미널에서 합니다, \u0026lsquo;vi\u0026rsquo; 를 사용하진 않지만요. 저는 \u0026ldquo;micro-emacs\u0026rdquo; 라고 불리는, 일부 키 바인딩이 비슷하단 점을 제외하면 GNU emacs 와 전혀 관련없는 혐오스런 것을 사용합니다. 전 헬싱키 대학에 있던 어린 시절부터 이것에 익숙해졌고, 이로부터 아직 졸업하지 못했어요, 조만간 그래야만 한다고 생각하지만요. 저는 몇년 전에 이 에디터에 (매우 약간의) utf-8 지원 기능을 추가했습니다만, 이젠 정말 이 도구의 나이가 보이기 시작하고, 80년대에 만들어졌다는 모든 징표를 보이고 있으며 제가 사용하는 버전은 90년대 중반부터 관리되지 않고 있는 한 fork 입니다.\n헬싱키 대학은 이게 DOS, VAX/VMS 와 유닉스에서 동작한다는 이유로 이걸 사용했고, 그게 제가 이걸 소개받은 이유입니다. 지금 제 손가락은 이것에 너무 익숙해졌습니다. 전 이제 정말 관리되고 있고 utf-8 을 올바르게 지원하는 무언가로 옮겨타야만 합니다. 아마도 \u0026rsquo;nano\u0026rsquo; 로 넘어갈 수 있겠죠. 하지만 제 과거의 쓰레기 작업물들은 제 늙은 손가락들에게 새로운 기술을 가르치도록 강제할 만한 것이 되진 않았죠.\n그러니 제 데스크탑 환경은 매우 간단합니다: 몇개의 텍스트 기반 터미널이 열려 있고, 웹브라우저에 이메일이 (그리고 몇개 더 탭이 있는데, 대부분 뉴스와 기술 사이트를 열어둡니다) 열려 있죠. 전 충분한 데스크탑 공간을 갖길 원하는데, 제법 큰 터미널 윈도우들에 (전 터미널을 100x40 크기로 일단 띄우고 필요에 따라 크기를 조정해 나갑니다) 익숙하고, 여러 터미널을 나란히 띄워두기 때문입니다. 그래서 두개의 4k 모니터를 사용하죠.\n전 제 컴퓨터에 페도라를 사용합니다, 그걸 \u0026ldquo;선호\u0026rdquo; 하기 때문은 아니고, 제가 거기 익숙하기 때문입니다. 전 배포판에 대해선 크게 신경쓰지 않습니다 - 제게 있어 그건 대부분 어떤 기계의 커널을 교체하고 그 위에서 일할 수 있게끔 리눅스를 설치하고 제 도구들을 셋업하기 위한 하나의 방법일 뿐입니다.\nJA: 리눅스 커널 메일링 리스트 는 커널 개발이 공개적으로 일어나는 곳이고, 매우 소통량이 많습니다. 그 수많은 이메일을 어떻게 다루시나요? 메일링 리스트 외부에서 협업하고 소통하기 위한 다른 방법들을 알아보셨나요, 또는 당신이 하는 일을 위해 완벽한 간단한 메일링 리스트 같은게 있나요?\nLT: 오, 전 커널 메일링 리스트를 직접 읽지 않아요, 수년째 그래왔어요. 그건 너무 너무 많아요.\n커널 메일링 리스트의 핵심은 그게 모든 토론에 cc로 붙는다는 (음 - 여러개의 커널 메일링 리스트들 가운데 하나가요, 그리고 전통적인 lkml 리스트는 더 적당한 리스트가 없을 때 사용됩니다) 점입니다. 그리고 그런 방법으로, 새로운 사람이 토론에 참여하게 될 때, 그들은 커널 메일링 리스트를 봄으로써 과거 기록과 배경을 알 수 있는 거죠.\n그러므로 저는 이 리스트를 구독하지만 제가 개인적으로 cc 되지 않은 모든 lkml 이메일은 자동으로 기록함으로 가게 해서 기본적으로는 전 그것들을 읽지 않게 해왔습니다. 하지만 이후에 어떤 문제가 제게 올라오면, 그 모든 토론은 필요해지기 전까지는 제 인박스에 있진 않았지만 제 이메일에 있기 때문에, 제게 보이게 되는 거죠.\n요즘은 저는 lore.kernel.org 기능을 대신 사용하는데, 그게 잘 작동하기도 하고 그걸 바탕으로 만들어진 도구들도 몇가지 있기 때문입니다. 따라서 제 메일 저장함으로 자동으로 옮겨지도록 하는 대신, 토론들이 그 방법으로 보여지게 합니다. 하지만 기본적인 워크플로우는 개념적으로 동일합니다.\n전 여전히 상당한 양의 이메일을 받습니다, 분명히요 - 하지만 여러 측면에서 수년간 상황이 좋아져 가고 있습니다. 그 중 큰 부분은 Git 과 커널 릴리즈 흐름이 잘 동작하고 있다는 점입니다: 우린 코드 흐름과 도구들에 대한 많은 문제들을 가져왔습니다. 제 이메일 상황은 20세기에서 21세기로 넘어오던 시절, 즉 여전히 거대한 패치 폭탄을 다뤄야 했고 개발 흐름에 큰 확장성 문제를 가지고 있던 때에는 정말 훨씬 훨씬 더 나빴습니다.\n그리고 이 메일링 리스트 (와 이를 둘러싼 도구 사용) 모델은 정말 잘 동작했습니다. 이는 사람들이 이메일 (1대1 메일과 메일링 리스트) 에 더해 다른 소통 수단을 사용하지 않는다는 말이 아닙니다: 다양한 실시간 채팅을 (IRC 가 전통적인 수단이죠) 좋아하는 사람들이 있습니다. 전 그걸 사용하지 않았지만, 어떤 사람들은 브레인스토밍에 그걸 사용하는 걸 좋아하는게 분명합니다. 하지만 \u0026ldquo;저장소로써의 메일링 리스트\u0026rdquo; 모델은 매우 잘 동작하며, 모든 \u0026ldquo;개발자간에 패치를 이메일로 보내기\u0026rdquo; 와 \u0026ldquo;문제 보고서를 이메일로 보내기\u0026rdquo; 와 함께 매끄럽게 잘 동작합니다.\n그러므로 이메일은 주요 소통 채널로 남아있고, 이메일에 패치를 포함시킴으로써 기술 문제를 토론하기 쉽게 합니다. 그리고 이건 여러 시간대에서 협업하는 환경에서도 잘 동작하는데, 이는 사람들이 지리적으로 흩어져 있을 때 매우 중요합니다.\nJA: 전 대략 10년간 커널 개발 동향을 자세히 들여다보며 이를 KernelTrap 에 블로깅하고 새로운 기능이 발전될 때마다 그에 대해서도 글을 써왔습니다. 전 이를 8년간 지속된 2.6.x 버전을 이어 3.0 커널이 릴리즈 되던 즈음부터 그만뒀습니다. 3.0 릴리즈 후 커널에 일어난 더 흥미로운 일들 몇가지를 요약해 주실 수 있을까요?\nLT: 헤헤. 그건 제가 요약을 시작할수도 없을 만큼 오래 전 일입니다. 3.0 이후 10년이 지났습니다, 그리고 그 시간 동안 많은 기술적 변화가 있었습니다. ARM 이 성장했고 ARM64 는 우리의 주요 아키텍쳐 중 하나가 되었습니다. 무척 많은 새로운 드라이버들과 핵심 기능들이 추가되었습니다.\n지난 10년간 흥미로운 것이 있다면 우리가 실제 개발 모델을 어떻게 정말 매끄럽게 유지했는가, 그리고 무엇이 변화되지 않았는가일 겁니다.\n우린 수십년간 여러 버전명 규칙과 개발 모델들을 사용해 왔지만, 3.0 릴리즈는 우리가 그간 사용해온 모델을 완성시켰습니다. \u0026ldquo;릴리즈는 시간 기반의 것임, 버전명의 숫자는 그저 숫자일 뿐이며 어떤 기능에 종속적이지 않음\u0026rdquo; 이라는 모든 원칙을 공식적이게 만든 것이죠.\n우리는 이 시간 기반 릴리즈를 2.6.x 시대 머지 윈도우부터 시작했으므로, 그 부분은 새로운 건 아니었습니다. 하지만 3.0 은 \u0026ldquo;숫자가 의미를 가지는\u0026rdquo; 것에 대한 마지막 흔적을 지워버렸습니다.\n우린 무작위 숫자 규칙을 가졌었고 (주로 1.0 전), \u0026ldquo;홀수 마이너 버전 숫자는 개발 커널을 의미하고 짝수 마이너 버전 숫자는 안정화된 제품 커널을 의미함\u0026rdquo; 모델을 사용했고, 그 후 2.6.x 시작과 함께 시간 기반 릴리즈 모델을 사용했습니다. 하지만 사람들은 여전히 \u0026ldquo;메이저 버전 숫자를 올리는 건 무슨 의미를 가질까\u0026rdquo; 라는 질문을 가지고 있었죠. 그리고 3.0 은 메이저 버전 숫자 또한 의미가 없음을, 우린 그저 숫자들이 쉽게 다룰 수 있도록, 너무 커지지 않도록 노력할 뿐임을 공식화 했습니다.\n지난 10년간, 우린 분명 거대한 변화들을 만들었습니다 (Git 이 통계 숫자를 쉽게 볼 수 있게 해줍니다: 17,000여명의 개발자에 의해 만들어진 75만여개의 커밋). 하지만 그 개발 모델 자체는 정말로 상당히 매끄럽고 안정적이었습니다.\n그리고 항상 그랬던 건 아닙니다. 커널 개발의 처음 20년간은 무척 고통스런 개발 모델 변화로 가득했습니다. 최근 10년은 릴리즈 측면에서 훨씬 예측 가능하게 되었습니다.\nJA: 지금 기준으로 가장 최신 릴리즈는 5.12-rc5 입니다. 릴리즈 프로세스는 얼마나 표준화 되었나요? 예를 들어, 어떤 종류의 변경사항들이 -rc1, -rc2 등으로 들어갑니까? 그리고 어느 시점에서 당신은 해당 릴리즈가 공식적으로 이뤄질 준비가 되었다고 결정하나요? 만약 당신이 틀렸고 최종 릴리즈 후에 큰 퇴행적 문제가 발견되면 어떤 일이 벌어지며, 그런 일이 얼마나 자주 일어나나요? 이 프로세스는 수년간 어떻게 발전해 왔습니까?\nLT: 전 이걸 앞에서 암시적으로 언급했습니다: 프로세스 자체는 정말 상당히 표준화 되었습니다, 그리고 지난 10년간 변하지 않았습니다. 그 전에는 여러번의 대격변을 거쳐왔습니다만 3.0 부터는 사실상 거의 시계장치처럼 되었습니다 (그리고 사실 그로부터 수년 전 - Git 으로의 전환이 여러 측면에서 오늘날의 프로세스의 시작이었으며, 모두가 거기 익숙해지기까진 시간이 조금 걸렸습니다).\n그러니까, 제가 생각하기로는 우린 지금까지 대략 15년간 \u0026ldquo;2주일의 머지 기간\u0026rdquo; 에 이어 최종 릴리즈 전에 대략 6-8개의 주간 릴리즈 후보를 내놓기를 계속해 왔습니다.\n그리고 그 규칙은 항상 동일했습니다, 항상 완전하고 엄격하게 강제된 건 아니었지만요: 머지 기간은 \u0026ldquo;테스트 되었고 준비되었다\u0026rdquo; 생각되는 새로운 코드를 위한 시간이고, 이어지는 대략 두달의 기간은 수정사항들을 받아들이고 모든 문제가 해결되었음을 확실히 하기 위한 시간입니다. 항상 그랬던 건 아니고, 어떤 때에는 \u0026ldquo;준비되었다\u0026rdquo; 여겨진 코드가 비활성화되거나 릴리즈 전에 완전히 제거되기도 했습니다.\n그리고 이게 반복됩니다 - 그러니 우린 대략 매 10주 정도마다 릴리즈를 합니다.\n그리고 이 릴리즈 기준은 제가 충분히 준비되었다는 자신감을 느끼는가로, 어떤 종류의 문제들이 여전히 보고되고 있는가에 기반합니다. 어떤 영역이 여전히 이 rc 게임 기준으로는 늦은 문제들을 보인다면, 전 문제에 연관된 변경사항들을 무효화 시켜버리고 \u0026ldquo;우린 이걸 완전히 이해한 후에 나중 릴리즈에서 처리합시다\u0026rdquo; 라고 말하는데 무척 적극적이 됩니다, 다만 전체적으로 이런 경우는 상당히 드뭅니다.\n이게 항상 잘 동작할까요? 아니요. 커널이 일단 릴리즈 되면 - 그리고 특히 어떤 배포판이 그걸 일단 골라잡으면 - 새로운 사용자가 생기고, 개발 중에는 그걸 테스트 하지 않았던, rc 시리즈 기간에 우리가 발견하지 못했던, 제대로 동작하지 않는 것들을 발견해내는 사람들이 생깁니다. 이건 피할 수 없는 문제에 가깝습니다. 이게 우리가 릴리즈 후에 수정 사항들을 추가하는 \u0026ldquo;안정화 (stable) 커널\u0026rdquo; 트리들을 갖는 이유 중 하나입니다. 그리고 일부 안정화 커널들은 다른 것들보다 더 오래 관리되어서 LTS (\u0026ldquo;Long Term Support\u0026rdquo;) 커널이라 불립니다.\n이 모든 것들이 지난 10년간 거의 변하지 않았습니다, 더 많은 자동화를 하게 되곤 했지만 말이죠. 커널 테스트 자동화는 일반적으로 어렵습니다만 - 부분적으로는 커널의 많은 부분이 하드웨어가 있어야 돌아갈 수 있는 드라이버들이기 때문이죠 - 부팅과 성능, 다양한 무작위적 부하 테스트를 하는 여러 곳이 존재합니다. 그리고 이게 수년간 상당히 개선되었습니다.\nJA: 작년 11월에 당신은 애플의 새 컴퓨터들에 장착된 애플의 신형 ARM64 칩에 감명받았다고 알려졌습니다. 리눅스에서 그것들을 지원하기 위한 개발 노력을 팔로우 하고 있나요? 그걸 위한 작업물이 \u0026lsquo;for-next\u0026rsquo; 에 머지된 걸 봤습니다. 조만간 나올 5.13 커널부터는 애플의 맥북 하드웨어가 리눅스로 부팅될 수 있을까요? 당신은 얼리어답터가 되곤 합니까? ARM64 는 얼마나 중요합니까?\nLT: 저는 매우 가끔 그걸 체크합니다만, 아직 그 작업은 초기 단계에 있습니다. 당신도 이야기 했듯, 이 초기 지원 기능이 5.13 에 머지될 확률이 높습니다, 하지만 그건 그저 시작 단계일 뿐이란 걸, 그리고 아직은 리눅스를 가지고 애플 하드웨어를 유용하게 운용할 수 있게 만들 수준은 아님을 알아두셔야 합니다.\n문제가 되는건 arm64 부분이 아니라, 그 주변에 위치하는 하드웨어를 (특히 SSD 와 GPU) 위한 드라이버들입니다. 지금까지, 그 초기 작업물은 일부 낮은 단계의 것들을 동작하게 만들어냈지만, 부팅 초기에 하드웨어를 사용 가능하게 하는것 외의 유용한 것은 어느것도 해내지 못했습니다. 사람들이 시도해 볼만한 진짜 선택 사항이 되기까지는 시간이 걸릴 겁니다.\n하지만 개선된 건 애플 하드웨어만이 아닙니다 - arm64 를 위한 인프라는 상당히 발전했고, 그 코어는 서버 환경에서 \u0026ldquo;그저 그런\u0026rdquo; 수준을 넘어서서 훨씬 경쟁적인 것이 되었습니다. 얼마전만 해도 arm64 서버 환경은 무척 슬픈 상황이었습니다만, Amazon 의 Graviton2 와 Ampere 의 Altra 프로세서들은 - 둘 다 훨씬 개선된 ARM Neoverse IP 에 기반해 있습니다 - 수년전에 제공되던 것들에 비해 훨씬 낫습니다.\n전 사용할 수 있는 ARM 기계를 이제 10년도 넘게 기다려왔습니다, 그리고 여전히 그 단계는 아니지만, 어느때보다도 그 때가 가까워진게 분명합니다.\n사실, 전 제가 ARM 기계를 그보다도 훨씬 오랫동안 원해왔다고 말할 수 있다고 생각합니다 - 제가 10대이던 시절, 제가 정말 원했던 건 Acorn Archimedes 였는데, 구하기도 어렵고 가격도 비싸서 Sinclair QL (M68008 프로세서) 쪽으로 방향을 틀어야 했고, 수년 후에는 i386 PC 를 대신 사용했죠.\n그러니 말하자면 수십년간의 개발이 이어졌습니다만, 그것들은 여전히 어디서나 구하기가 쉽지는 않고 컴퓨터로써의 가성비가 제게는 충분하지 않습니다. 어느 날인가는 그렇게 될겁니다. 바라건대, 너무 멀지는 않은 미래에요.\nJA: 커널 내에 최적화 되어 있지 않으며 그걸 제대로 해결하려면 완전히 재작성해야 하는 부분이 있을까요? 달리 말하자면, 커널은 서른살이나 나이를 먹었고 지식, 언어, 그리고 하드웨어는 그 30년간 많이 바뀌었습니다: 만약 당신이 지금부터 무언가를 바닥부터 다시 작성한다면, 무엇을 바꾸겠습니까?\nLT: 사실 우린 필요하다면 무언가를 완전히 재작성하는데에도 무척 훌륭했습니다, 따라서 해결되지 않은, 재앙이 될만한 것들은 재작성된 지 오래입니다.\n물론, 우린 상당히 많은 \u0026ldquo;호환성\u0026rdquo; 계층들이 있습니다만, 그것들은 일반적으로 끔찍하지는 않아요. 그리고 설령 그것들을 바닥부터 재작성 한다고 해도 그 호환성 계층들이 사라질 것인지도 분명치 않습니다 - 그것들은 오래된 바이너리들을 위한 하위 호환에 대한 (그리고 종종 오래된 아키텍쳐, 예를 들어 32-bit x86 앱을 x86-64 에서 돌리는, 하위 호환을 위한) 것들입니다. 전 하위 호환을 매우 중요하다고 여기기 때문에, 저는 설령 재작성을 하더라도 그것들은 유지하고 싶습니다.\n모든 것은 개선될 수 있다는 점에서 \u0026ldquo;최적화 되지 않은\u0026rdquo; 것들은 분명 많습니다, 하지만 당신의 질문의 논조를 놓고 보건대, 그 중 제가 경멸하는 것은 어느 것도 없다고 말해야겠습니다. 누구도 정리를 할만큼 신경쓰지도 않을, 따라서 추한 일들을 할지도 모르는 구식 드라이버들이 있습니다, 하지만 여기서 핵심은 \u0026ldquo;아무도 신경쓰지 않음\u0026rdquo; 입니다. 그건 문제가 되지 않아왔습니다, 그리고 그게 문제가 되는데 그게 우리가 그걸 신경쓸 사람을 찾을 수 없는 구식 지원이라면 그걸 제거해 버리는 데에 상당히 적극적이 되곤 합니다. 따라서 수년간 우리는 많은 수의 드라이버를 제거해 왔고, 더이상 유지보수할 의미가 없는 경우엔 아키텍쳐 전체 지원도 제거해 왔습니다.\n\u0026ldquo;재작성\u0026rdquo; 의 유일한 주요 이유는 전체 구조가 더이상 말이 되지 않는 어떤 사용 사례를 찾았을 경우일 겁니다. 가장 있을법한 시나리오는 리눅스가 제공하는 모든 것을 필요로 하지 않는, 그리고 매우 적은 하드웨어 사용량을 가져서 지난 세월동안 거대해진 리눅스보다는 더 작고 간단한 무언가를 원하는, 어떤 작은 임베디드 시스템 같은 경우가 되겠습니다.\n리눅스는 거대해졌으니까요. 오늘날에는 작은 하드웨어 (예를 들어 휴대폰을 생각해 봅시다) 도 리눅스가 처음 개발된 기계보다 훨씬 기능이 많습니다.\nJA: 성능과 안전성을 위해 특별히 설계된 언어인 Rust 를 이용해 최소 일부 부분을 재작성하는 건 어떻게 생각합니까? 이 방법으로 개선해볼 곳이 있습니까? Rust 같은 다른 언어가 커널의 C 를 대체하는 것이 가능할 수는 있다고 느끼십니까?\nLT: 우린 지켜볼 겁니다. 전 Rust 가 커널의 핵심부에 사용될 거라고는 생각지 않습니다, 하지만 개별 드라이버들 (그리고 어쩌면 전체 드라이버 서브시스템들) 을 그걸로 돌리는 건 완전히 불가능하게 들리지는 않습니다. 어쩌면 파일시스템도요. 그러니 \u0026ldquo;C 를 대체\u0026rdquo; 하는 건 아니지만, \u0026ldquo;말 되는 곳에서는 C 코드를 강화\u0026rdquo; 시키는 것에 가깝겠습니다.\n물론, 특히, 드라이버는 실제 커널 코드의 절반 가량을 차지합니다, 따라서 Rust 로 개선할 공간이 많습니다, 하지만 누구도 현존하는 드라이버들을 대대적으로 Rust 로 재작성할 것이라 기대하진 않는다고, 그보다는 \u0026ldquo;어떤 사람들은 새 드라이버를 Rust 로 짤 수도, 몇몇개의 드라이버는 그게 말이 된다면 재작성될 수도 있겠다\u0026rdquo; 고 생각하는 편에 가깝습니다.\n하지만 지금 당장의 상황은 \u0026ldquo;사람들이 그걸 시도해 보고 가지고 놀고 있다\u0026rdquo; 에 불과합니다. 장점을 내세우기는 쉽지만, 분명한 복잡성도 존재합니다, 따라서 저는 그 약속된 장점들이 정말로 실현될 것인지 기다리며 지켜보는 접근법을 취할 겁니다.\nJA: 개인적으로 커널에서 가장 자랑스러운 특별한 부분이 있습니까?\nLT: 제가 이야기 하곤 하는 부분은 VFS (\u0026ldquo;virtual filesystem\u0026rdquo;) 계층 (그리고 특히 pathname 탐색) 과 VM 코드입니다. 앞의 것은 리눅스가 그 기본적인 일들을 (pathname 을 탐색하는 건 운영체제의 매우 핵심 작업입니다) 현존하는 그 무엇보다도 훨씬 잘 하기 때문입니다. 그리고 뒤의 것은 우리가 20개 이상의 아키텍쳐를 지원하고, 우린 여전히 통합된 VM 계층으로 그걸 해내고 있는데, 제 생각에 이건 무척 인상적이기 때문입니다.\n하지만, 이는 또한 \u0026ldquo;커널의 어떤 부분을 당신은 신경쓰십니까\u0026rdquo; 라는 질문이기도 합니다. 커널은 뭐가 가장 중요한지에 대해 다른 개발자들은 (그리고 다른 사용자들이) 다른 의견을 가질 수 있기 충분할 정도로 거대합니다. 어떤 사람들은 스케쥴링이 커널의 가장 짜릿한 부분이라 생각합니다. 또다른 사람들은 디바이스 드라이버의 핵심을 찌르는 부분을 (우린 그런 것들을 많이 가지고 있습니다) 좋아합니다. 전 개인적으로 VM 과 VFS 영역에 더 참여하는 경향이 있으므로, 자연적으로 그것들을 꼽게 됩니다.\nJA: Pathname 탐색에 대한 설명 을 찾았는데, 제가 생각한 것보다 더 복잡하군요. 무엇이 리눅스의 구현을 다른 운영체제의 것들에 비해 훨씬 낫게 만듭니까? 그리고 \u0026ldquo;더 낫다\u0026rdquo; 는 말로 당신이 의미하는 건 뭡니까?\nLT: Pathname 탐색은 커널 개발자 외의 대부분의 사람들은 그걸 문제라고 여기지도 않을 정도로 흔하고 기본적인 것입니다: 그들은 그저 파일을 열고 그 모든 걸 당연한 것으로 여기죠.\n하지만 그건 정말 잘하기가 무척 복잡합니다. 모든 것들이 항상 pathname 탐색을 하기 때문에, 그건 무척 성능에 중요하고, SMP 환경에서 당신 역시 확장 가능하길 바라는 영역 중 하나일 것이 분명하고, 락킹 (locking) 관련한 복잡성이 높기 때문입니다. 그리고 당신은 어떤 IO 도 하고 싶지 않을 게 분명합니다, 따라서 캐쉬 사용이 매우 중요합니다. 사실, pathname 탐색은 그걸 낮은 단계의 파일시스템이 하도록 둘 수 없을 정도로 중요한데, 우린 20개가 넘는 다른 파일시스템을 가지고 있고 그것들이 각자의 캐쉬 사용과 락킹을 하도록 두는건 완전한 재앙이 될 것이기 때문입니다.\n따라서 VFS 계층이 하는 주요 작업 중 하나는 pathname 요소들의 모든 락킹과 캐쉬 사용을 처리하고, 모든 직렬화와 mount point 횡단을 처리하고, 모든 일을 대부분 lock-free 알고리즘 (RCU) 으로 , 경우에 따라선 일부 무척 영리한 lock 같은 것들을 (리눅스 커널의 \u0026ldquo;lockref\u0026rdquo; lock 은 매우 특수한 \u0026ldquo;레퍼런스 카운트를 갖는 spinlock\u0026rdquo; 으로 말 그대로 dcache 사용을 위해 설계되었으며, 기본적으로는 많은 일반적 상황에서 lock 사용을 제거할 수 있는 특수한 락을 인지하는 레퍼런스 카운트입니다) 사용해 처리하는 것입니다.\n결과: 낮은 단계의 파일 시스템들은 캐쉬에 올라오지 않은 것들을 위해선 여전히 탐색을 해야 하지만, pathname 탐색을 위한 캐쉬 사용과 모든 일관성 규칙들과 원자성 규칙들에 대해선 걱정하지 않아도 됩니다. VFS 가 그것들을 위해 이 모든 걸 처리합니다.\n그리고 그건 모든 다른 운영체제들이 구현한 모든 것보다 성능이 나으며, 수천개의 CPU 를 가진 기계에서조차 기본적으로는 완전하게 확장됩니다. 그리고 그 기계들이 같은 디렉토리들을 건드는 경우에조차 그렇습니다 (루트 디렉토리나 프로젝트 홈 디렉토리 같은 것들에는 많은 수의 쓰레드로 돌아가는 어플리케이션이라 해도 쓰레드별 행동 같은 것으로 분산되지 않고 모두 동시에 접근하려 할 것이니까요).\n따라서 이건 단순히 \u0026ldquo;더 나은\u0026rdquo; 게 아니라, \u0026ldquo;더 나은\u0026rdquo; 것입니다, \u0026lsquo;더\u0026rsquo; 에 대한 강조와 함께 말이죠. 어떤 것도 여기 근접하지 않고 있습니다. 리눅스의 dcache 는 자신만의 클래스에 있습니다.\nJA: 작년은 전세계적으로 힘든 해였습니다. COVID-19 판데믹은 커널 개발 프로세스에 어떤 영향을 끼쳤습니까?\nLT: 실제로 매우 최소한의 영향만을 끼쳤습니다, 우리가 항상 일해온 방식 때문입니다. Email 은 실로 놀라운 도구임이 드러났고, 우린 대면 미팅에 의존하지 않았습니다.\n그래요, 작년의 연간 커널 서밋에는 영향을 미쳤습니다 (그리고 올해도 불투명합니다 \u0026ndash; 역자 주: 2021년 커널 서밋도 virtual 로 가게 되었습니다), 그리고 대부분의 컨퍼런스가 취소되거나 가상으로 전환되었습니다. 그리고 전에는 사무실에서 일하던 사람들이 집에서 일하기 시작했습니다 (하지만 많은 코어 커널 메인테이너들은 이미 그래왔습니다). 그러니 많은 것들이 바뀌었지만, 핵심 개발 그 자체는 전과 동일하게 동작했습니다.\n그리고 그건 우리 모두의 삶에 다른 형태로 영향을 끼친 것 같습니다 - 그저 일반적인 사회적 영향이요. 하지만 전체적으로 보면 우린 이미 사람들과 거의 전부 이메일로만 소통해오던 커널 개발자들이었기에 가장 적게 영향받은 사람들일 겁니다.\n분산 버전 컨트롤 시스템, Git JA: 리눅스는 당신의 오픈소스에의 여기저기 퍼져있는 공헌들 가운데 하나에 불과합니다. 2005년에 당신은 또한 엄청나게 인기 있는 분산 소스 컨트롤 시스템인 Git 을 만들었죠. 당신은 리눅스 커널 소스 트리를 독점 소프트웨어인 Bitkeeper 에서 새로 만들어진 오픈소스 기반의 Git 으로 곧바로 옮겼고, 같은 해에 관리 권한을 Junio Hamano 에게 넘겼습니다. 여기에 매력적인 역사적 일들이 많이 있습니다, 무엇이 당신에게 이 프로젝트의 리더쉽을 그렇게 빨리 넘기도록 만들었으며, 당신은 어떻게 Junio 를 발견하고 선택했습니까?\nLT: 이에 대한 답변은 두 부분으로 나뉠 수 있겠습니다.\n첫번째 부분은 저는 새로운 소스 컨트롤 시스템을 만들고 싶지 않았다는 겁니다. 리눅스는 제가 하드웨어와 소프트웨어 간의 낮은 단계의 인터페이스가 매력적임을 발견했기 때문에 만들었습니다. 반면에, Git 은 필요에 의해 만들어졌습니다: 제가 소스 컨트롤이 흥미롭다고 여겨서가 아니라, 당시 존재하던 대부분의 소스 컨트롤 시스템을 경멸했고, 제가 발견한 입에 맞고 리눅스 개발 모델을 위해 상당히 잘 동작했던 것 (BitKeeper) 은 더이상 사용할 수 없게 되었기 때문이었습니다.\n그 결과: 전 리눅스를 30년 넘게 개발하고 있습니다 (첫번째 릴리즈의 기념일은 아직 몇달 남았습니다만 전 리눅스가 될 것의 개발을 30년 전에 이미 시작했습니다), 그리고 그동안 이것을 계속 유지보수해 왔습니다. 하지만 Git 은요? 전 제가 그걸 장기적으로 유지보수하고 싶다고 한번도 생각하지 않았습니다. 전 그걸 사용하는 건 좋아합니다, 그리고 분명히 세계에 존재하는 최고의 SCM 이라고 생각합니다, 하지만 그건 제 근본적인 열정과 흥미가 아닙니다, 제가 말하고자 하는게 뭔지 안다면 이해하시겠죠.\n그렇기 때문에 전 항상 누군가가 그 SCM 을 저를 위해 유지보수해 주기를 원했습니다 \u0026ndash; 사실 애초에 그걸 만들 일도 없었다면 가장 행복했을 겁니다.\n이게 말하자면 그 배경입니다.\nJunio 에 대해 말하자면 - 그는 Git 개발자로 나선 바로 첫번째 사람들 가운데 한명이었습니다. 그는 제가 Git 의 첫번째 (그리고 매우 조악한) 버전을 공개한지 몇일만에 그의 변경사항들을 보내왔습니다. 그러니 Junio 는 실제로 Git 의 초창기부터 함께해 왔습니다.\n하지만 제가 첫번째로 나타난 아무에게나 프로젝트를 넘긴 건 아니었습니다. 전 Git 을 몇달동안 유지보수했고, 제가 Junio 에게 그가 메인테이너가 되고 싶은지 물어보게끔 만든 것은 설명하기 어려운 \u0026ldquo;좋은 취향\u0026rdquo; 에 대한 것이었습니다. 이걸 위한 더 나은 설명을 저는 못하겠습니다: 프로그래밍은 기술적 문제를 해결하는 것입니다만, 그걸 어떻게 해결하는가, 그걸 어떻게 생각하는가 또한 중요하고, 그건 시간에 걸려 깨닫게 되는 것들 중 하나입니다: 많은 사람들이 그 \u0026ldquo;좋은 취향\u0026rdquo; 을 갖고 \u0026ldquo;옳은\u0026rdquo; 해결책을 고릅니다.\n저는 프로그래밍이 예술이라 말하고 싶지는 않습니다, 그건 대부분 그저 \u0026ldquo;좋은 엔지니어링\u0026rdquo; 이기 때문입니다. 전 토마스 에디슨의 \u0026ldquo;1퍼센트의 영감과 99퍼센트의 땀\u0026rdquo; 이야기를 믿습니다: 그건 작은 디테일들과 매일 끙끙대는 일의 거의 본질입니다. 하지만 그 \u0026ldquo;영감\u0026rdquo; 부분도 존재합니다, 단순히 어떤 문제를 해결하는 것을 넘어서는 그 \u0026ldquo;좋은 취향\u0026rdquo; 이요 - 깨끗하고 훌륭하게, 그리고 그래요, 심지어 아름답게.\n그리고 Junio 는 그 \u0026ldquo;좋은 취향\u0026rdquo; 을 가지고 있었습니다.\n그리고 매번 Git 이 이야기 될 때마다, 전 그걸 아주 아주 분명하게 기억하려 노력합니다: 제가 Git 의 개발을 시작했고 그 핵심 아이디어들을 설계했을 거예요, 하지만 전 종종 그 부분만을 가지고 너무 많은 명성을 받습니다. 15년이 넘게 지났습니다, 그리고 전 그 첫번째 해에만 Git 에 참여했습니다.

LinnOS 는 Hedging 과 유사하지만 각 SSD 로의 각 I/O 가 빠르게 처리될지 예측하는 신경망을 이용합니다. 이를 위해, 해당 신경망은 현재 I/O queue depth, 최근의 몇개 I/O 시 queue depth 와 latency 를 입력으로 받고 그 결과 레이턴시가 빠를지 느릴지만 예측합니다. 잘못된 예측으로 인한 문제를 처리하기 위해선 biased learning 과 예측 정확도에 따른 adaptive hedging 을 사용합니다. 신경망의 학습은 오프라인으로 이루어집니다.\nDo OS abstractions make sense on FPGAs? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-cp4U3JKug\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nHeterogeneous computing system 이라고도 불리는, FPGA 를 내장한 컴퓨터 시스템이 널리 사용되고 있습니다. 이런 시스템에는 운영 복잡성이 높게 마련이며, 특히 FPGA 용 어플리케이션의 개발과 배포가 복잡합니다. 때문에 FPGA 관리를 위해 운영체제의 추상화 개념이 일부 사용되고 있습니다. 저자는 Coyote 라고 하는, 운영체제의 일반적 추상화 개념을 모두 지원하는 FPGA 관리 도구를 만들어 운영체제 추상화 개념이 FPGA 에 잘 적용되는지 실험했고, 그에 대한 긍정적 결과를 얻었습니다.\nFast RDMA-based Ordered Key-Value Store using Remote Learned Cache https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-0YL_SII4\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\n서버 중심적 key-value store (KVS) 는 서버의 CPU 에 성능이 제한되므로, RDMA 기반의 방법들이 제안되어왔습니다. 한번의 RDMA 에 한번의 RTT 가 소요되므로, 이 방법은 여러번 네트워크 순회를 해야 하는 문제가 있어 성능이 떨어지는 문제가 있습니다. 인덱스를 클라이언트 내에 캐시해 두는 해결책도 있습니다만, 클라이언트의 메모리 사용량을 급격하게 늘린다는 문제가 있습니다. 이 논문의 저자들은 신경망을 인덱스로 사용하자는 제안을 합니다. 키를 입력으로 받아 밸류의 주소를 내놓는 신경망을 서버 측에서 학습시키고, 전체 인덱스에 비해 훨씬 작은 이 신경망을 클라이언트로 전송, 각 클라이언트가 이 신경망을 캐시로 사용해 밸류의 서버내 주소를 알아내고, RDMA 로 한번에 밸류를 얻어오는 방법입니다.\nA Simpler and Faster NIC Driver Model for Network Functions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKJIY4vbBDA\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nBridge, router, firewall 등의 기능을 소프트웨어로 구현하려는 software-defined network 방식이 널리 사용되고 있습니다. 이 과정에서 성능과 유연성을 위해 소프트웨어 복잡도를 높이는 경향이 있었습니다. 결과, software-defined network stack 의 안정성을 검증하기도 어려워졌습니다. 저자팀은 약간의 유연성을 희생함으로써 단순하면서 성능 높은 network stack 구현이 가능함을 주장하며, 자신들의 새로운 네트워크 드라이버 모델, tinynf 로 이를 증명합니다. 이 드라이버 모델을 바탕으로 구현된 Intel 82599 드라이버는 550줄밖에 안되는 코드로 기존 state-of-the-art 드라이버보다 7배 빨리 formal verification 을 마칠 수 있었고, 성능 역시 1.6배 높았습니다.\nTheseus: an experiment in operating system structure and state management https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1pLDZKtlBI\n이 논문에서 저자들은 Theseus 라는 이름의, state spill 문제를 해결할 수 있도록 설계된 운영체제를 선보입니다. 해당 문제의 해결을 위해 \u0026lsquo;cell\u0026rsquo; 이라 불리는 다수의 작은 컴포넌트로 운영체제를 구성시켰으며, Rust 와 같은 언어 수준에서의 안전성 보장 메커니즘들을 운영체제 단계에 적용시켰습니다.\nSpecification and verification in the field: Applying formal methods to BPF just-in-time compilers in the Linux kernel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2V3ts5-W_9g\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nBPF 프로그램은 수행되기 전에 검증되지만, 그 검증 이후에 JIT 를 통해 컴파일 된 후에 수행됩니다. 따라서, JIT 에 버그가 있다면 문제가 생길 수 있습니다. 이 논문의 저자들은 JIT 의 정확성 명세 프레임웍, jitterbug 를 사용해 RISC-V 를 위한 새로운 BPF JIT 를 개발했습니다. 이 과정에서 만들어진 커널 변경사항은 메인라인 리눅스 커널에 머지되었습니다.\nStorage Systems are Distributed Systems (So Verify Them That Way!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s8EeXcu_8Y\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\n스토리지 시스템도 높은 복잡도를 갖기에 기계적으로 검증을 하기 까다롭습니다. 이 논문의 저자들은 그런 스토리지 시스템의 구조가 분산 시스템과 비슷한 측면이 있음을 발견하고 분산 시스템의 기계적 검증을 위해 제안된 방법을 보다 범용화 해서 스토리지 시스템에 적용합니다. 이를 바탕으로 저자팀은 VeriSafeKV 라는 검증 가능한 key-value storage 를 만들었습니다.

AIFM solves the semantic gap using new data structure abstraction and provides user space runtime that don\u0026rsquo;t need kernel space time consumption. As a result, the application is required to be modified, but the authors argue it\u0026rsquo;s only modest change. Compared to other state-of-the-art (FastSwap from EuroSys'20), it achieved 13x speedup.\nLinnOS: Predictability on Unpredictable Flash Storage with a Light Neural Network https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzv9lcjxhAg\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not easy to predict each I/O speed of modern fast storage devices, due to their complex internals like the caching, the wear-leveling and the garbage collection. One well-known solution is hedging. It prepare an array of SSDs, issue I/O to one of them, and if the response doesn\u0026rsquo;t made until a timeout, revoke the request and try with another SSD. The wait time limit bounds the latency. LinnOS uses an approach similar to the hedging, but it uses a neural network that can predict if each I/O to each SSD will be served fast or not. For this, the neural network receives current I/O queue depth and queue depths and latencies of last few I/Os as input. Then, it predicts if the latency will be only fast or slow. To mitigate with the effect from wrong predictions, it uses biased learning and adaptive hedging based on the prediction accuracy. The network is learned offline.\nDo OS abstractions make sense on FPGAs? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-cp4U3JKug\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nComputer systems embedding FPGA in addition to CPU, called heterogeneous computing systems, are widesparead nowadays. These systems typically have high operational complexity. Especially developing and deploying FPGA application is quite complicated. For the reason, some manufacturers provide some FPGA shells providing some of the OS abstractions. The authors developed a FPGA shell called Coyote, which provides full abstraction sets of the OS and experimented if it works well for the systems. The result was very positive.\nFast RDMA-based Ordered Key-Value Store using Remote Learned Cache https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-0YL_SII4\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nBecause server-centric key-value store (KVS) performance bound to the server CPUs, RDMA-based approaches were proposed. Because one RTT is required for one RDMA, the approaches require many round trips and therefore doesn\u0026rsquo;t show high performance. Caching the index in client is one solution, but it makes huge client memory footage. The authors propose to use neural network as the index cache. They train neural network to receive key and provide logical address of the value for the key in server. The network retrained for dynamci updates and copyied to clients. Then, client use the nerual network, which is much smaller than the full index tree to know the address of the value and fetch it via the RDMA.\nA Simpler and Faster NIC Driver Model for Network Functions https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKJIY4vbBDA\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nSoftware-defined network approach, which implements functionality of appliances like bridege, router, firewall is widespread. For better performance and flexibility, the software complexity has increased so that it\u0026rsquo;s hard to do formal verification of the network stacks. The authors argue that by sacrificing some of the fliexibility, it\u0026rsquo;s available to implement simple and fast network stack. They prove their idea with a new network driver model, tinynf. They implemented a driver for Intel 82599 based on the driver model with only 550 lines of code. It was able to finish formal verification 7x faster than a state-of-the-art driver. Also, it achieved 1.6x performance compared to the state-of-the-art.\nTheseus: an experiment in operating system structure and state management https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1pLDZKtlBI\nIn this paper, the authors present an OS called Theseus that designed for state spill problem.

Therefore, if there is a bug in the JIT, real problem occurs. The authors of this paper devloped a new BPF JIT for RISC-V with a JIT correctness specification framework, jitterbug. The changes made to the kernel are merged into the mainline kernel.\nStorage Systems are Distributed Systems (So Verify Them That Way!) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s8EeXcu_8Y\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nStorage systems have high complexity, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard to do the verification. The authors of this paper realized the architecture and charactersitics of the storage systems are similar to those of distributed systems, and applied the verification methodologies for distributed systems to the storage systems after making it more general. Based on this, they implemented a verifiable key-value storage, VeriSafeKV. The performance of it was similar to unverified DB systems.\nCaladan: Mitigating Interference at Microsecond Timescales https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-v3ndwixOI\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nOn a system, multiple workloads that has different requirements co-scheduled. For example, some workloads only need best-effort resources while others require strict tail latency. Because the workloads share some hardware resources like LLC and memory bandwidth, it\u0026rsquo;s hard to fulfill all the requirements. Well know solution is resource partitioning. Because static partitioning could result in low resource utilization, dynamic partitioning solutions were previously proposed. However, the dynamic partitioning doesn\u0026rsquo;t provide microsecond granularity decision, while 100 microseconds is the marginal timewindow to guarantee the tail latency problem, according to the authors\u0026rsquo; arguments. The authors propose to use different interference signals and design the system to work in micro-second level.\nSemeru: A Memory-Disaggregated Managed Runtime https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFA3MmNDKaM\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nConstructing system as distributed machines for different works such as CPU works and memory works are know ans resource-disaggregated architecture and gaining popularity. However, the architecture is usually written for native applications rather than GC-based applications. This paper introduces JVM runtime, Semeru, which is designed for resource-disaggregation architecture.\nPANIC: A High-Performance Programmable NIC for Multi-tenant Networks https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EB6dK3L8Jzg\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nMulti-tenant networks require generality, flexible chaining, isolation, and performance to programmable NIC. However, current programmable NICs doesn\u0026rsquo;t support those. Authors propose a new programmable NIC design for the requirements and introduce an implementation on FPGA, PANIC.\nServing DNNs like Clockwork: Performance Predictability from the Bottom Up https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHOpY_MY57Y\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nNowadays, data center serves for many machine learning models for different users. Even though the latency of each inference is predictable because it has no conditional branches, the models serving system could result in unpredictable end-to-end latency. This paper proposes a new machine learning models serving system that designed do protect the latency.\nTeting Configuration Changes in Context to Prevent Production Failures https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrGKmp3ALKQ\u0026amp;feature=emb_title\nIn this paper, a new test framework called \u0026lsquo;ctest\u0026rsquo; is proposed for validation of configuration changes that can made in production environment.

Folio 를 제하면 448달러. 아슬아슬하게 합리적인 가격이라 생각합니다.\n총평 가히 궁극의 종이 대체제가 될 수 있는 기기라고 평하겠습니다. 필기와 pdf / epub 파일 읽기라는 최소한의 목적에 맞추어 깔끔하게 만들어진 기기입니다. 목적이 일치한다면 돈값을 할거라 생각합니다. 만약 웹브라우징도 되고 앱도 설치/구동되는 범용 태블릿을 원한다면 다른 기기를 알아보는 게 좋을 겁니다.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/remarkable2_review/","summary":"올해 초, 우연히 전자잉크 태블릿인 Remarkable 2 의 소개 영상 을 보게 되었습니다. 간단하지만 분명한 목표 (\u0026lsquo;종이\u0026rsquo;와 같은 사용경험) 에 집중한 디자인과 기능이 무척 매력적으로 다가왔습니다. 망설이다 7월에 한번 더 사이트에 들어가 봤는데, 선주문 기간인데다 팬데믹 등의 영향으로 11월에야 배송된다고 하더군요. 한달 내로는 무료 반품도 된다길래 고민할 시간은 많으니 일단 지르고 고민해 보자는 생각으로 질렀습니다.\n한참의 시간이 지나, 지난 월요일에 마침내 제품을 받게 되었습니다. 개인적으로 처음 구매해 본 전자잉크 기기인데, 이제 겨우 일주일 됐지만 제법 만족스럽게 사용 중입니다.","title":"Remarkable 2 리뷰"},{"content":"다양한 형태로 생각을 기록하고 가끔은 공유도 해왔습니다. 그 생각들을 오래도록 안전히 보관하고 싶었지만 몇차례 시행착오를 거치며 그게 쉽지 않음을 깨달았습니다.\n시작은 일기장과 노트였습니다. 분실하기도 쉽고 구석에 쳐박아 두면 다시 볼일도 거의 없더군요.\n클라우드 문서 서비스가 매력적이어 보였습니다. 하지만 영원한 건 없고 결국 그때 그때 흥하는, 또는 사용 가능한 서비스를 옮겨다녀야 하더군요. 그러다보니 서비스마다의 호환성이 문제가 됩니다.\nhttps://yargerdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cloudmeme.jpg\nHugo 와 같은 README 등 표준적 포맷의 plain text 기반 static site generator 를 사용하고 Git 으로 원격 repo 도 관리하는 게 괜찮은 방법 같아 보였습니다. 지금 이 블로그도 이 방법으로 관리하고 있습니다. 하지만 다른 테마로 이동할 때마다 생각보다 만질 부분이 꽤 있더군요. 또한 혼자 간직하고 싶은, 또는 잠깐 떠오르는 짧은 생각들을 간단하게 기록하기엔 생각보다 번거로웠습니다.\n결국 나만의 규칙 아래 plain text 로 파일에 생각을 적어 git 으로 관리하게 되었습니다. 가장 낫긴 한데 여러 기계를 사용하면 동기화 하는걸 가끔 잊어버려 곤란한 상황에 직면하곤 했습니다. 나만의 규칙이라 해봤자 날짜를 기록하는 정도인데 그 포맷도 그때그때 헷갈리구요. 생각마다 다른 파일에 적을지 달마다 다른 파일에 적을지도 고민이었습니다. 그때그때 git 커맨드를 추가로 작성해야 하는것도 정말 짧은 생각만 관리하기엔 부담으로 느껴지더군요. 특히 핸드폰에서는 파일 수정하고 git 을 사용하기가 쉽지 않으니 사실상 다른 앱에 생각을 적어두고 나중에 컴퓨터 앞에서 git 으로 옮겨 관리하는데 그것도 별로였습니다.\n결국 제가 원하는 건 트위터 수준으로 간단히 짧은 생각들을 작성하는 인터페이스와 third party 의존성 없는 안전한 관리였습니다.\n그래서 간단한 도구를 만들었습니다. 날짜와 같은 주요 메타데이터를 Git 으로 안전히 관리하며, 모든 생각을 그때 그때 원격 저장소로 동기화 합니다. 핸드폰에서 tmux 등으로 사용하기 충분할 정도로 간단한 커맨드 라인 인터페이스를 제공합니다. 예를 들면:\n$ st new \u0026#34;Thanks for all the fish\u0026#34; $ st show Sat Oct 3 11:21:14 2020 +0200 Thanks for all the fish 아주 간단한 포맷의 plain text file 로의 export / import 기능을 제공하므로 복잡한 히스토리 관리는 물론 다른 포맷으로의, 으로부터의 변환 역시 간단합니다. 예전에 매뉴얼하게 Git 으로 관리하던 기록들을 최근에 이 기능을 이용해 import 했는데 드디어 하나의 통합된 제 생각 관리가 가능할 것으로 기대합니다.\n무엇보다, 아날로그 때의, 마음가는대로 아무 페이지나 펴서 무작위로 글을 읽으며 추억에 빠지는 경험을 되살리고 싶었는데, 됩니다.\n$ st show --random Wed Mar 8 22:30:00 1978 +0000 The first episode of \u0026#34;The Hitchhiker\u0026#39;s Guide to the Galaxy\u0026#34; will now broadcast. 아직 다듬을 부분이 많고 추가할 기능도 많지만 일단 제 개인 목적으로 쓰기 시작한지는 제법 되었고 이제는 남들도 사용은 해볼 수 있을 것 같아 이렇게 소개해 봅니다.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/shallow_thought/","summary":"다양한 형태로 생각을 기록하고 가끔은 공유도 해왔습니다. 그 생각들을 오래도록 안전히 보관하고 싶었지만 몇차례 시행착오를 거치며 그게 쉽지 않음을 깨달았습니다.\n시작은 일기장과 노트였습니다. 분실하기도 쉽고 구석에 쳐박아 두면 다시 볼일도 거의 없더군요.\n클라우드 문서 서비스가 매력적이어 보였습니다. 하지만 영원한 건 없고 결국 그때 그때 흥하는, 또는 사용 가능한 서비스를 옮겨다녀야 하더군요. 그러다보니 서비스마다의 호환성이 문제가 됩니다.\nhttps://yargerdotblog.files.wordpress.com/2019/02/cloudmeme.jpg\nHugo 와 같은 README 등 표준적 포맷의 plain text 기반 static site generator 를 사용하고 Git 으로 원격 repo 도 관리하는 게 괜찮은 방법 같아 보였습니다.","title":"Shallow Thought: Simple and safe thoughts management"},{"content":"This post has migrated to https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon-tests_open_sourced.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/damon-tests_open_sourced/","summary":"This post has migrated to https://damonitor.github.io/posts/damon-tests_open_sourced.","title":"Tests package for DAMON is released under GPL v2"},{"content":"My talk proposal to the Linux Kernel Summit of this year which is co-located with the Linux Plumbers Conference has accepted!

This belief is due to the lack of RCU-centric update synchronization mechanisms. RCU instead works with a range of update-side mechanisms, such as locking. In fact, many developers embrace simplicity by using global locking. Logging, hardware transactional memory, or fine-grained locking can provide better scalability, but each of these approaches has limitations, such as imposing overhead on readers or poor scalability on non-uniform memory access (NUMA) systems, mainly due to their lack of NUMA-aware design principles.\nThis project introduces an RCU extension (RCX) that provides highly scalable RCU updates on NUMA systems while retaining RCU’s read-side benefits. RCX combines hardware transactional memory (HTM) and traditional locking based on our NUMA-aware design principles for RCU.

In that case, git send-email automatically add From: line pointing the real author of the patch in the body of the mail so that maintainers applying the patches can set the author information correctly.\nFor example, if \u0026ldquo;Alice alice@abc.com\u0026rdquo; has made a commit and \u0026ldquo;Bob bob@abc.com\u0026rdquo; formats the commit into a patch file and sends it, git send-email automatically adds From: Alice \u0026lt;alice@abc.com\u0026gt; line in the body of the mail. And, when a maintainer is applying the patch using git am, the patch is applied with author \u0026ldquo;Alice alice@abc.com\u0026rdquo;.\nHowever, please note that git send-email knows the situation by comparing the author information and the command caller\u0026rsquo;s git user eamil configuration or given \u0026lsquo;\u0026ndash;from\u0026rsquo; option only, not considering real smtp email account.\nFor example, suppose that Alice has two email accounts, alice@abc.com and alice@def.com. And, Alice wants to use alice@abc.com as her email address in the git history, but needs to send her patches using def.com SMTP server. She might use below commands.\n$ git config sendemail.smtpserver smtp.def.com $ git config sendemail.smtpuser alice@def.com $ git config user.email \u0026#34;alice@abc.com\u0026#34; $ git commit -as -m \u0026#39;the patch\u0026#39; $ git format-patch HEAD^ $ git send-email 0001_the_patch.patch Because her git config is saying the user.email is alice@abc.com and the patch is authored by alice@abc.com, git send-email thinks same people is sending the patch. Thus, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t add the \u0026lsquo;From:\u0026rsquo; line in the body of the mail. Of course, git send-email tries to set the from of the mail as alice@abc.com, but as the additionally specified \u0026lsquo;from\u0026rsquo; information is usually (at least gmail does) ignored by the SMTP server, the maintainer will receive the mail saying author email as \u0026lsquo;alice@def.com\u0026rsquo; only.\nNote that git send-email considers the email address it tries to use as the from address, not the final one that SMTP server will use. Thus, this problem can be worked around in weird way using the --from option of the git send-email. In the above case, giving --from \u0026quot;Alice \u0026lt;alice@def.com\u0026gt;\u0026quot; option to git send-email makes the command to think the sender is not the author (alice@abc.com) and as a result, it adds the From: line in the body.\nAlso, please note that adding --from option does not always add the From: line in the body. Rather than that, it can even hide the From: line you intended to add, if you give the address that same with the commit\u0026rsquo;s author, regardless of what SMTP server you use. For example,\n$ git config sendemail.smtpserver smtp.def.com $ git config sendemail.smtpuser alice@def.com $ git config user.email \u0026#34;alice@abc.com\u0026#34; $ git commit -as -m \u0026#39;the patch\u0026#39; $ git format-patch HEAD^ $ git config user.email \u0026#34;alice@def.com\u0026#34; $ git send-email --from alice@abc.com 0001_the_patch.patch If the final command had no --from option, it would added the From: in-body line. However, because it specifies the real author address using --from option, git send-email thinks the real author is sending this mail and omits the From: line in the body.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/git_send_email_multiple_email_caution/","summary":"In some case, we need to send patches that made by other people instead. git send-email command can know this situation by itself by comparing the commit author information and mail sender\u0026rsquo;s information.

The VM will be booted with the Ubuntu server install image, as same as when you boot a machine with an install media. As usual, proceed the install of the Ubuntu server on the VM. This post will use ssh to connect to the VM. Install openssh pacakge while the install process.\nNow, you can boot your Ubuntu VM as below:\n$ sudo ./bin/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 20G -smp 32 -enable-kvm \\ -drive if=virtio,file=qc2img,cache=none \\ -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2242-:22 -net nic -nographic Because of the -nographic option, it will not give you GUI interface but shows Booting from Hard Disk... message only. But, the VM is booted well. You can ssh to the VM via the port, 2242.\n$ ssh localhost -p 2242 Connect Console to Terminal Let\u0026rsquo;s connect the VM\u0026rsquo;s console to the QEMU executing terminal. Modify the /etc/default/grub file\u0026rsquo;s GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT to have \u0026quot;console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 ftrace_dump_on_oops\u0026quot;.\nYou may also want to show GRUB when boot. Comment out GRUB_TIMEOUT_STYLE=hidden, give none-zero value to GRUB_TIMEOUT=, and Uncomment GRUB_TERMINAL=console.\nFinally, commit the change by:\n$ sudo update-grub $ sudo shutdown -h now After this, if you start the VM again using the QEMU command, the terminal you executed the QEMU command will be connected with the console of the VM and will show boot log and login prompt.\nReturn to VM Monitor Console If you want to go back to the VM monitor console, which you have seen before connecting the QEMU executed terminal to the VM\u0026rsquo;s console, press Ctrl+a c. If you want to go back to the guest console again, press Ctrl+a c enter.\nReference: https://serverfault.com/questions/471719/how-to-start-qemu-directly-in-the-console-not-in-curses-or-sdl\nBoot with Kernel in Host You can boot the VM to use a kernel image in the file system of the host machine. If you want to keep your development environment on your host machine but use the QEMU as a test target device, this is useful. Give the path to the kernel image file via -kernel option and give the kernel parameter you want to use using -append option. For example:\n$ sudo ../qemu/build/x86_64-softmmu/qemu-system-x86_64 -m 2048 -smp 2 \\ -enable-kvm -drive if=virtio,file=debian.img,cache=none \\ -net user,hostfwd=tcp::2242-:22 -net nic -nographic \\ -kernel /linux.out/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \\ -append “root=/dev/vda1 console=ttyS0 earlyprintk=ttyS0 debug ignore_loglevel ftrace_dump_on_oops” For the root= in the kernel parameter, check which device file is mounted as the rootfs by the guest OS and use it.\nAlso, you cannot use modules built on the host in the VM, unless you send the module binary files into the VM. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to do that, simply build the modules you need in static. For example, as this post uses the ssh, I statically built the ethernet driver.\nImage Resize The guest os disk might be full soon, if you configured it too small.

Minsky was a founder of the MIT Media Lab and pioneer in A.I. who died in 2016. Stallman argued on a mailing list (in response to a statement from a protest organizer accusing Minsky of sexual assault) that, while he condemned Epstein, Minsky likely did not know she was being coerced:\nWe can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates. Some SJW responded by writing a Medium post called \u0026ldquo;Remove Richard Stallman\u0026rdquo;. Media outlets like Vice and The Daily Beast then lied and misquoted Stallman as saying that the woman was likely \u0026ldquo;entirely willing\u0026rdquo; and as \u0026ldquo;defending Epstein\u0026rdquo;. He has now been pressured to resign from MIT\nFurthermore the deposition doesn\u0026rsquo;t say she had sex with Minsky, only that Epstein told her to do so, and according to physicist Greg Benford she propositioned Minsky and he turned her down:\nI know; I was there. Minsky turned her down. Told me about it. She saw us talking and didn’t approach me. This seems like a complete validation of the distinction Stallman was making. If what Minsky knew doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, if there\u0026rsquo;s no difference between \u0026ldquo;Minsky sexually assaulted a woman\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Epstein told a 17-year-old to have sex with Minsky without his knowledge or consent\u0026rdquo;, then why did he turn her down?\nEdit: He has also resigned from the Free Software Foundation, which he founded.

Stallman argued on a mailing list (in response to a statement from a protest organizer accusing Minsky of sexual assault) that, while he condemned Epstein, Minsky likely did not know she was being coerced:\nWe can imagine many scenarios, but the most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to tell her to conceal that from most of his associates. Some SJW responded by writing a Medium post called \u0026ldquo;Remove Richard Stallman\u0026rdquo;. Media outlets like Vice and The Daily Beast then lied and misquoted Stallman as saying that the woman was likely \u0026ldquo;entirely willing\u0026rdquo; and as \u0026ldquo;defending Epstein\u0026rdquo;. He has now been pressured to resign from MIT\nFurthermore the deposition doesn\u0026rsquo;t say she had sex with Minsky, only that Epstein told her to do so, and according to physicist Greg Benford she propositioned Minsky and he turned her down:\nI know; I was there. Minsky turned her down. Told me about it. She saw us talking and didn’t approach me. This seems like a complete validation of the distinction Stallman was making. If what Minsky knew doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, if there\u0026rsquo;s no difference between \u0026ldquo;Minsky sexually assaulted a woman\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Epstein told a 17-year-old to have sex with Minsky without his knowledge or consent\u0026rdquo;, then why did he turn her down?\nEdit: He has also resigned from the Free Software Foundation, which he founded. Grim news for free software, since I think true-believing purists like Stallman are vital to prevent various kinds of co-option.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/rms_resigns/","summary":"몇일 전, 리차드 스톨만이 FSF 회장은 물론이고 의장직에서도 사임한다는 소식이 전해졌습니다. 무슨 일이 있었는지 아래의 reddit 코멘트가 가장 잘 설명하고 있다는 LWN 코멘트[1] 를 참고해, 해당 reddit 코멘트를 번역해 봅니다.\n[1] https://lwn.net/Articles/799391/\n최근 공개된 한 여성의 증언에 따르면 그녀가 17세 때, Epstein 이 그녀에게 Marvin Minsky 와 성관계를 가지라고 했습니다.

Linux 1.3.50 에서 mem_map 의 원소들은 마침내 struct page 로 이름지어졌습니다.\n이 평평한 메모리 매핑은 물리 페이지 프레임 번호 (page-frame number : PFN) 와 그에 대응되는 struct page 사이의 쉽고 빠른 변환을 제공했습니다; 이 변환 작업은 간단한 배열 인덱스 계산 문제였습니다. 이후 struct page 의 레이아웃 변경이 있었는데, 새로운 사용처 (예컨대, page cache) 들과 struct page 의 캐시 성능 최적화를 위한 것이었습니다. 메모리 매핑은 깔끔하고 효율적인 평평한 배열로 유지되었습니다만, 이는 중요한 단점을 가지고 있었습니다: 물리 주소 공간 상의 큰 공백을 처리할 수 없었습니다. 이 메모리 매핑 가운데 공백에 연관된 부분은 낭비되어지거나, ARM 에서처럼, 메모리 매핑 자체가 공백을 가질 수 있었습니다.\nDISCONTIGMEM 상당히 비연속적인 물리 메모리를 효율적으로 처리하기 위한 지원이 리눅스를 NUMA 기계들 위에서 잘 동작하도록 하기 위한 노력의 일환으로 1999년에 메모리 관리 서브시스템으로 들어왔습니다. 이 코드는 CONFIG_DISCONTIGMEM 설정 옵션에 종속적이어서, 이 메모리 모델은 DISCONTIGMEM 이라 이름지어진 첫번째 모델이었습니다.\n이 DISCONTIGMEM 모델은 메모리 노드 (memory node) 라는 개념을 소개했는데, 이 개념은 여전히 NUMA 메모리 관리의 기본으로 남아있습니다. 각 노드는 free-page lists, in-use page lists, least-recently-used (LRU) 정보, 사용 통계 등을 포함한, (대부분) 독립적인 메모리 관리 서브시스템을 갖습니다. 이런 것들 가운데, struct pglist_data (또는 짧게 pg_data_t) 로 표현되는 노드 데이터는 하나의 노드에 대한 메모리 매핑 정보를 가지고 있습니다. 각 노드가 연속적인 물리 메모리를 가지고 있다는 가정 하에, 노드당 하나의 struct page 배열을 갖는 것은 평평한 메모리 매핑 안의 거대한 공백 문제를 해결했습니다.\n하지만 이게 공짜로 된 건 아닙니다. DISCONTIGMEM 에서는, 예를 들면 어떤 PFN 을 그에 연관된 struct page 로 변환하기 위해 특정 페이지를 어떤 노드가 가지고 있는지를 알 수 있어야 합니다. 비슷하게, 페이지를 가지고 PFN 을 구하기 위해 어떤 노드의 메모리 맵이 해당 struct page 를 가지고 있는지도 알 수 있어야 합니다. 긴 진화의 끝에, KVADDR_TO_NID(), LOCAL_MAP_BASE(), ADDR_TO_MAPBASE(), 그리고 LOCAL_BASE_ADDR() 매크로를 처음 정의한 mips64 부터 시작해서 PFN 의 struct page 로의 변환과 그 반대 작업은 include/asm-generic/memory_model.h 안에 정의된, 비교적 간단한 pfn_to_page() 와 page_to_pfn() 매크로로 수행되게 되었습니다.\n하지만, DISCONTIGMEM 은 약점이 있었습니다: 메모리 핫플러그 (hotplug) 와 핫리무브 (hot remove) 입니다. 실제 NUMA 노드는 실제 핫플러그를 지원하기엔 너무 굵은 크기였고, 노드를 쪼개는 것은 불필요한게 많은 단편화와 오버헤드를 가져올 것이었습니다. 각 노드가 독립적인 메모리 관리 구조체들을 연관된 비용과 함께 가짐을 기억해 보세요; 노드를 쪼개는 것은 그런 비용을 상당히 증가시킬 겁니다.\nSPARSEMEM 이 한계는 SPARSEMEM 을 통해 해결되었습니다. 이 모델은 메모리 매핑을 아키텍쳐별로 정의된 임의의 크기의 섹션들의 집합으로 추상화 했습니다. 각 섹션은 struct mem_section 으로 표현되며, (코드에 설명된 바에 따르면): \u0026ldquo;논리적으로, struct page 의 배열로의 포인터입니다. 하지만, 다른 마술을 통해 저장됩니다\u0026rdquo;. 이 섹션들의 배열은 SECTION_SIZE 크기로 효율적으로 쪼개질 수 있는 메타 메모리 매핑입니다. PFN 과 struct page 사이의 효율적인 변환을 위해, PFN 의 상위 비트 몇개는 이 섹션 배열로의 인덱스로 사용됩니다. 반대 방향 변환을 위해선, 이 섹션 넘버가 page 의 flag 로 인코딩 됩니다.\n이 모델이 리눅스 커널에 소개되고 몇달 후, SPARSEMEM 은 SPARSEMEM_EXTREME 으로 확장되었는데, 이 모델은 산재하는 물리 주소 공간을 갖는 시스템에 적합합니다. SPARSEMEM_EXTREME 에서는, 첫번째 레벨은 mem_section 구조체들로의 포인터가 되고, 실제 mem_section 객체는 실제로 꽂힌 물리 메모리에 기반해서 동적으로 할당됩니다.\n2007년에 SPARSEMEM 의 또다른 개선이 이루어졌습니다; 이는 SPARSEMEM 의 일반적인 가상 메모리 매핑 지원 또는 SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 이라고 불렸습니다. SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 의 아이디어는 전체 메모리 매핑이 가상 연속 공간에 매핑되어 있지만, 활성화된 섹션들만이 물리 페이지로 연결되어 있도록 하자는 것입니다. 이 모델은 32-bit 시스템에서는 물리 메모리의 크기가 가상 주소 공간을 넘을 수 있기 때문에 잘 동작하지 못할 수 있습니다. 하지만, 64-bit 시스템에서 SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 은 확실히 우수합니다. 추가적인 페이지 테이블 엔트리 사용이라는 비용 아래, page_to_pfn() 과 pfn_to_page() 는 평평한 모델만큼이나 간단해 졌습니다.\nSPARSEMEM 메모리 모델의 마지막 확장은 꽤 최근 (2016) 이었습니다; 이는 persistent 메모리 디바이스의 사용 증가로 인해 이루어졌습니다. 메모리 매핑을 메인 메모리가 아니라 그런 디바이스들 내에 직접 저장하는 걸 지원하기 위해, 이 가상 메모리 매핑은 struct vmem_altmap 을 사용할 수 있게 되었는데, 이 구조체는 persistent 메모리 안의 페이지 구조체를 제공합니다.\n2005년으로 돌아가보면, SPARSEMEM 은 \u0026ldquo;새로운, 그리고 실험적인 discontiguous memory 의 대체재\u0026rdquo; 로 설명되었습니다. SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 을 추가한 커밋은 그것을 \u0026ldquo;우리가 SPARSEMEM 을 대부분의 시스템에 기본 (그리고 유일한) 옵션이 되게 할 가능성이 있다\u0026rdquo; 고 했습니다. 그리고 실제로, 일부 아키텍쳐는 DISCONTIGMEM 에서 SPARSEMEM 으로 옮겨탔습니다. 2008년, SPARSEMEM_VMEMMAP 은 x86-64 를 위한 유일한 메모리 모델이 되었는데, FLATMEM 보단 조금 비싸지만 DISCONTIGMEM 보다는 효율적이기 때문입니다.\n메모리 핫플러그, persistent 메모리 지원, 다양한 성능 최적화와 같은 최근의 메모리 관리 분야 개발은 모두 SPARSEMEM 모델을 타겟으로 하고 있습니다. 하지만 과거의 모델들은 여전히 존재해서, 아키텍쳐와 메모리 관리 코드 상의 많은 #ifdef 블록의 존재와, 관련된 구성 옵션의 특별한 미로의 존재라는 추가비용을 유발하고 있습니다. 남아있는 DISCONTIGMEM 사용자들을 SPARSEMEM 으로 완전히 바꿔타게 하려는 노력들이 있습니다만, ia64 나 mips64 와 같은 아키텍쳐들을 그렇게 변화시키기는 쉬운 작업이 아닐 겁니다. 그리고 ARC 아키텍쳐의 DISCONTIGMEM 사용은 \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; 메모리 아래 \u0026ldquo;high memory\u0026rdquo; 영역의 존재를 갖는데, 이는 분명 변경하기 어려울 겁니다.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/lwn_memory_flat_discontiguous_sparse/","summary":"LWN 의 \u0026ldquo;Memory: the flat, the discontiguous, and the sparse\u0026rdquo; 라는 제목의 글의 한글 번역입니다. 원문은 LWN 에서 볼 수 있습니다: https://lwn.net/Articles/789304/\nMay 27, 2019\n이 기사는 Mike Rapoport 에 의해 기여되었습니다.\n컴퓨터 시스템에서 물리 메모리는 소중한 자원이어서, 이를 효율적으로 관리하기 위한 많은 노력이 기울여져왔습니다. 이 일은 현대의 시스템에서의 메모리 구조가 복잡해짐에 따라 더 어려워졌습니다. 물리 메모리가 실제로 어떻게 위치해 있는가를 다루기 위한 여러 계층의 추상화가 존재합니다; 그런 추상화 중 하나는 \u0026ldquo;메모리 모델\u0026rdquo; 이라고 불립니다.","title":"Memory: the flat, the discontiguous, and the sparse (Korean)"},{"content":"우연히 발견한 글 을 통해 NASA 의 코딩 규칙 10가지 를 알게 되었습니다. 너무 깐깐한 규칙 아닌가 싶기도 하지만 ping 하나 날리는데 40분이 걸리고 물리적으로는 접근할 수 없는 화성에 로봇을 보내야 한다면 이런 규칙은 합리적이라 볼 수 있겠죠. 제가 참고한 저 글은 이걸 파이썬이나 자바스크립트와 같은 곳에서도 어떻게 적용해 볼 수 있을지를 고찰해 보고 있습니다. 이 포스트에선 단순히 이 10개의 규칙을 번역해 봅니다.\ngoto 또는 재귀호출과 같은 복잡한 수행 흐름을 피하라. 원문: 모든 코드를 매우 간단한 수행 흐름으로 제한하라 - goto 문, setjmp 또는 longjmp 명령, 그리고 직/간접적 재귀 호출을 사용하지 말라.\nAvoid complex flow constructs, such as goto and recursion. Restrict all code to very simple control flow constructs – do not use goto statements, setjmp or longjmp constructs, and direct or indirect recursion.\n모든 루프 (반복문) 은 고정된 최대 반복 횟수를 가져야 한다. 이는 무한반복 코드를 방지한다. 모든 루프는 고정된 최대 반복 횟수를 가져야 한다. 코드 체크 도구가 정적으로 어떤 루프의 반복 횟수가 미리 설정된 최대 횟수를 넘는지를 쉽게 검사할 수 있어야 한다. 이 반복 한계가 정적으로 검증될 수 없다면, 이 규칙이 깨어진 것으로 간주한다.\nAll loops must have fixed bounds. This prevents runaway code. All loops must have a fixed upper-bound. It must be trivially possible for a checking tool to prove statically that a preset upper-bound on the number of iterations of a loop cannot be exceeded. If the loop-bound cannot be proven statically, the rule is considered violated.\n힙 메모리 할당을 피하라. 초기화 단계 후에는 동적 메모리 할당을 사용하지 말라.\nAvoid heap memory allocation. Do not use dynamic memory allocation after initialization.\n함수의 크기를 한장의 종이에 적힐 수 있게 제한하라. 어떤 함수도 명령문당 한줄, 선언당 한줄을 갖는 표준 레퍼런스 포맷을 지킨 채로 한장의 종이에 프린트 될 수 있는 길이 이상을 가져선 안된다. 보통, 이는 함수당 60줄 이상의 코드를 가져선 안된다는 것을 의미한다.\nRestrict functions to a single printed page. No function should be longer than what can be printed on a single sheet of paper in a standard reference format with one line per statement and one line per declaration. Typically, this means no more than about 60 lines of code per function.\n최소 함수당 두개의 런타임 단정문을 사용하라. 평균적으로 함수당 최소 두개의 단정문이 있어야 한다. 단정문은 실제 수행 중에 일어나선 안되는 문제가 있는 조건을 검사하는데 사용되어야 한다. 단정문은 항상 사이드 이펙트로부터 자유로워야 하고 Boolean 테스트로 정의되어야 한다. 단정문이 실패한다면 명시적인 복구 동작이 행해져야 하는데, 예를 들면 이 실패한 단정문을 수행한 함수를 호출한 측에 에러 정보를 리턴하는 것이다. 정적 검사 도구가 절대 실패할 수 없거나 항상 성공한다고 증명해내는 단정문은 모두 이 규칙을 어기는 것이다. (예를 들어, 전혀 도움 되지 않을 assert(true) 문을 추가함으로써 이 규칙을 만족시킬 순 없다.)\nUse a minimum of two runtime assertions per function. The assertion density of the code should average to a minimum of two assertions per function. Assertions are used to check for anomalous conditions that should never happen in real-life executions. Assertions must always be side-effect free and should be defined as Boolean tests. When an assertion fails, an explicit recovery action must be taken, e.g., by returning an error condition to the caller of the function that executes the failing assertion. Any assertion for which a static checking tool can prove that it can never fail or never hold violates this rule. (I.e., it is not possible to satisfy the rule by adding unhelpful \u0026ldquo;assert(true)\u0026rdquo; statements.)\n데이터의 사용 영역을 가능한 작게 잡아라. 데이터 객체는 가능한 가장 작은 단계의 영역에서 선언되어야만 한다.\nRestrict the scope of data to the smallest possible. Data objects must be declared at the smallest possible level of scope.\n리턴 타입이 void 가 아닌 (non-void) 모든 함수의 리턴값은 검사되거나 리턴값이 무의미하다는 걸 알리기 위해 void 로 캐스팅 되어야 한다. non-void 함수의 리턴값은 각 호출 함수에 의해 체크되어야 하며, 패러미터의 유효성은 각 함수 안에서 검사되어야 한다.\nCheck the return value of all non-void functions, or cast to void to indicate the return value is useless. The return value of non-void functions must be checked by each calling function, and the validity of parameters must be checked inside each function.\n전처리기를 아껴 사용하라. 전처리기의 사용은 헤더 파일을 포함하는 용도와 간단한 매그로 정의로 국한되어야만 한다. 토큰 붙이기, 유동적 갯수의 인자 리스트, 그리고 재귀적 매크로 호출은 허용되지 않는다. 모든 매크로는 완전한 구문적 단위로 확장되어야만 한다. 조건적 컴파일 지시어의 사용은 많은 경우 모호하지만, 항상 금지될 수는 없다. 이는 거대한 소프트웨어 개발 노력이 든다 하더라도 동일한 헤더 파일의 중복 포함을 방지하는 상용문 외의 한두개의 조건적 컴파일 지시어를 위한 정당화가 필요하다는 것을 의미한다. 그런 모든 경우에는 도구 기반의 검사를 통한 플래그가 붙어있거나 코드 안에 사용의 정당성에 대한 설명이 있어야 한다.\nUse the preprocessor sparingly. The use of the preprocessor must be limited to the inclusion of header files and simple macro definitions. Token pasting, variable argument lists (ellipses), and recursive macro calls are not allowed. All macros must expand into complete syntactic units. The use of conditional compilation directives is often also dubious, but cannot always be avoided. This means that there should rarely be justification for more than one or two conditional compilation directives even in large software development efforts, beyond the standard boilerplate that avoids multiple inclusion of the same header file. Each such use should be flagged by a tool-based checker and justified in the code.\n포인터의 사용을 한단계 디레퍼런스로 제한하고, 함수 포인터는 사용하지 말라. 포인터의 사용은 제한되어야 한다. 구체적으로, 두단계 이상의 디레퍼런스는 허용되지 않는다. 포인터 디레퍼런스 오퍼레이션이 매크로 정의나 typedef 선언 안에 숨겨져선 안된다. 함수 포인터는 허용되지 않는다.\nLimit pointer use to a single dereference, and do not use function pointers. The use of pointers should be restricted. Specifically, no more than one level of dereferencing is allowed. Pointer dereference operations may not be hidden in macro definitions or inside typedef declarations. Function pointers are not permitted.\n모든 가능한 경고를 활성화 한 채 컴파일 하라; 그리고 모든 경고는 해당 소프트웨어의 배포 전에 해결되어야 한다. 모든 코드는 개발을 시작한 첫날부터 모든 컴파일러 경고가 가장 엄중한 설정으로 활성화 된 채 컴파일 되어야만 한다. 모든 코드는 이 설정 아래 아무런 경고 없이 컴파일 되어야 한다. 모든 코드는 최소 하루에 한번, 그러나 가급적 한번 넘게, 최신의 정적 소스 코드 분석도구를 통해 검사되어야 하며 이 검사를 어떤 경고도 없이 통과해야만 한다.\nCompile with all possible warnings active; all warnings should then be addressed before release of the software. All code must be compiled, from the first day of development, with allcompiler warnings enabled at the compiler’s most pedantic setting. All code must compile with these setting without any warnings. All code must be checked daily with at least one, but preferably more than one, state-of-the-art static source code analyzer and should pass the analyses with zero warnings.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/nasa_coding_rules/","summary":"우연히 발견한 글 을 통해 NASA 의 코딩 규칙 10가지 를 알게 되었습니다. 너무 깐깐한 규칙 아닌가 싶기도 하지만 ping 하나 날리는데 40분이 걸리고 물리적으로는 접근할 수 없는 화성에 로봇을 보내야 한다면 이런 규칙은 합리적이라 볼 수 있겠죠. 제가 참고한 저 글은 이걸 파이썬이나 자바스크립트와 같은 곳에서도 어떻게 적용해 볼 수 있을지를 고찰해 보고 있습니다. 이 포스트에선 단순히 이 10개의 규칙을 번역해 봅니다.\ngoto 또는 재귀호출과 같은 복잡한 수행 흐름을 피하라.","title":"NASA's Power of 10 Coding Rules (Korean)"},{"content":"My talk proposal to the Linux Kernel Summit of this year which is co-located with the Linux Plumbers has accepted!

Leetcode 는 왜 이제 알게 됐나 싶은 생각이 들 정도로 도움이 되었습니다.\n링크드인 및 이력서 지인들과의 대화 도중, 링크드인은 내가 지금 직업을 구하고 있는지 아닌지를 알리는 기능이 있다는 걸 우연히 알게 되었습니다. 이걸 켜니 몇몇 회사의 리크루터들이 연락을 줬습니다. 이 회사도 마찬가지였습니다. 채용하는 포지션에 대한 아주 짧막한 설명과 함께, 관심 있으면 이력서를 보내달라는 연락이 왔고, 이력서를 보내니 회사의 해당 포지션 채용 링크를 보내주며 시스템을 통해 지원해 달라고 했습니다.\n온라인 코딩 사흘만에 이 회사에서 구축한 코딩 테스트 시스템으로의 초대장이 왔습니다. Leetcode 와 같은 여타 코딩 테스트 사이트랑 비슷하게 되어 있는데, 네개 정도의 문제가 있습니다. 편한 시간을 골라서 문제를 풀 수 있으며, 테스트를 시작하면 중단은 못하고 두시간 내에 테스트를 반드시 끝내야 합니다. 실제 인터뷰어와 전화를 통해 진행하는게 아니다보니 내가 편한 시간을 고를 수 있고, 영어 듣기가 부족한 저로썬 문제가 글로 써져 있어 좋더군요. 제출하고 나면 곧바로 풀이에 대한 전체 테스트 결과도 볼 수 있었습니다.\n아주 어려운 문제는 없었고 간단한 자료구조와 알고리즘 위주였기에 무난하게 문제를 풀 수 있었습니다. 하지만 마지막 한문제는 일부 corner case 를 제대로 풀지 못해 점수가 만족스럽지는 않았습니다.\n전화 인터뷰 몇일 후, 전화 인터뷰 하고 싶으니 일정을 잡자는 메일이 왔습니다. 적당히 일정을 잡고 인터뷰를 진행했습니다.\n애초에 외국 회사는 온사이트 인터뷰까지 진행되면 후보에게 비행기표 등을 지불해야 되니 이 단계에서 가급적 많은 후보자를 탈락시킨다고 합니다. 전화 통화는 바디랭귀지가 일체 허용되지 않거니와 통화품질, 인터뷰어의 독특한 억양 등의 문제가 있을 수 있기에 저처럼 영어가 약한 사람에게는 정말 죽을 맛입니다. 다행히도 이번 인터뷰는 통화품질도 좋았고 인터뷰어의 발음도 제 귀에 또렷하게 들리는 억양이라 큰 문제는 없었습니다. 그래도 역시 기본 실력이 어디가진 않아서, 몇번은 못알아듣고 버벅이긴 했습니다.\n인터뷰는 약 한시간 정도 분량으로, 제가 채용되면 함께 일하게 될 팀과 업무, 그리고 인터뷰어 자신에 대한 간단한 소개를 시작으로, 제 소개와 그에 대한 문답, 업무적 경험에 대한 질문, 기술적 질문으로 이어졌고, 막판에 약 5분 정도 제가 회사에 대해 질문할 수 있는 시간으로 구성되었습니다.\n소개 후의 문답은 제가 소개한 제 연구들에 대해 깊은 질문이 왔는데, 평소 하는 일이라 쉽게 대답할 수 있었습니다.\n업무적 경험에 대한 문답에서는 어떤 특정 상황에 처했던 경험을 이야기 해달라고 하는데, 이게 꽤 어려웠습니다. 질문받은 경우에 처한 경험이야 많지만 그 중 어떤 걸 골라서 이야기해야 좋은 인상을 얻을까 고민하게 되거든요. 팀원의 반대 의견에 부딪혔을 때에 대한 경험도 요청받았는데, 재밌게도 그날 아침에 함께 연구를 진행하고 있는 친구와 격렬하게 토론했던 즐거운 경험이 있어 그걸 이야기 했습니다. 다른 질문들에는 오픈소스 활동과 개인 프로젝트에 대한 경험도 이야기 했습니다.\n기술적 질문은 커널의 동작 구조 및 원리에 대한 몇가지 질문이 있었습니다. 역시 밥먹고 하는 일이다 보니 어렵지 않게 답할 수 있었습니다.\n마지막 질답 시간엔 무슨 질문했는지 기억이 잘 안나는데, 내가 이 면접 통과하고 함께 일하게 되면 어떤 일을 하게 될지, 내가 소개한 연구들 중 어떤 내용이 회사에 도움 될 수 있을거라 생각하는지 뭐 그런 질문을 한 것 같습니다.\n전화 중에도 코딩 테스트가 있을 줄 알았는데, 없었습니다. 다행이었죠.\n온사이트 인터뷰 제의 다시 몇일 후, 2차 전화 인터뷰가 있겠거니 하고 있었는데, 온사이트 인터뷰를 보자는 메일이 왔습니다! 예전에 모 회사와는 대략 네다섯번까지 이어지는 전화 인터뷰를 하면서 파김치가 되었던 기억이 있는데, 이번엔 한번의 전화 인터뷰만에 스크리닝이 끝나서 정말 기뻤습니다. 메일은 온사이트 인터뷰 가능한 일정 (3주의 기한을 줬습니다), 일하게 된다면 언제부터 일할 수 있는지, 원하는 연봉은 얼마인지, 인터뷰 보러 오는데 비자 필요한지 등을 물어왔습니다.\n적당적당히 일정이 잡혔고, 회사에서 비행기표와 호텔을 예약해 줬습니다. 호텔은 이틀을 예약해 줬습니다. 앞에서 이야기했듯 사실 이때까지만 해도 전 이 회사에 붙을 거라는 생각은 없었습니다. 회사가 면접 통과하기 어렵기로 유명한 회사이기도 하고 준비가 부족하다고 생각했으니까요. 이 시점까지만 해도 그저 공짜로 외국여행 하는구나 싶었죠.\n온사이트 인터뷰 온사이트 인터뷰는 채용되면 실제 제가 일하게 될 오피스에서 아침 10시부터 오후 4시까지 6시간동안 이루어졌습니다. 한시간마다 한명씩 다른 인터뷰어가 들어왔는데, 중간에 한번은 두 인터뷰어가 함께 들어왔습니다. 따라서 총 여섯번의 인터뷰를 본 셈이며, 매 인터뷰마다 형식은 전화 인터뷰와 비슷했습니다. 인터뷰어의 회사와 자기 자신에 대한 소개, 제 소개와 그에 대한 문답, 업무적 경험 질문, 기술적 질문, 마지막으로 제가 질문하는 시간.\n붙을리가 있냐, 여행이나 하자 하는 생각으로 왔지만 막상 당일이 되자 굉장히 긴장되더군요. 그런데 이날 만난 직원들은 너무나도 친절하고 유쾌했습니다. 막상 면접이 시작되니 면접을 본다기보다는 기술 커뮤니티 밋업에서 만난 사람들이랑 즐거운 기술 이야기 하는 느낌이라 너무 즐거웠습니다.\n오후 12시부터 한시간은 점심시간이라 인터뷰어 한명과 함께 식사했습니다. 식사가 인터뷰의 연장인 셈이죠. 앞서 이야기한대로 어찌나 긴장이 풀렸는지 이 때 인터뷰어 앞에서 맥주까지 한잔 했습니다.\n그 중 두번의 인터뷰는 화이트보드를 사용한 코딩 인터뷰가 포함되었습니다. 그 와중에 가장 긴장한 시간이었긴 한데, 역시 즐겁게 진행되었습니다. 다행히 평범한 자료구조 문제였기에 조금 버벅이긴 했지만 일단 코딩을 하는건 어렵지 않았으며, 이후 관련한 질문에 답하고 개선을 어떻게 할 수 있을지 논의하고 추가 코딩을 했는데 이 과정 역시 즐거웠습니다.\n인터뷰가 끝나고 나선 붙든 떨어지든 상관 없지만 평생 잊지 못할 만큼 즐거운 시간이었고 이런 시간을 앞으로도 갖고 싶다, 떨어져도 여한이 없다는 생각이 들었습니다. 면접을 본게 아니라 커뮤니티 모임 같은데 가서 놀다 온 느낌이었죠.\n오퍼 온사이트 인터뷰가 금요일이었습니다. 현지 시간으로 화요일, 인터뷰에 통과했으니 정식 오퍼를 보내겠다는 연락을 받았습니다.\n정리 준비부터 오퍼를 받기까지의 제 경험을 정리해 봤습니다. 준비도 능력도 부족한데 어디까지나 운이 좋아서 면접을 통과한지라 다른 분들께 이 기록이 얼마나 도움이 될지 모르겠습니다. 그래도 공유하지 않는 것보다는 낫겠죠. 누군가에겐 이 기록이 도움이 되길 빌어봅니다.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/my_job_interview/","summary":"이번 여름 졸업을 앞두고 구직 활동을 한 결과, 얼마전 운좋게도 미국에 본사를 두고 있는 한 글로벌 IT 기업의 커널/하이퍼바이저 팀으로부터 잡 오퍼를 받았습니다. 취업을 향한 한걸음 한걸음이 어둠 속을 더듬더듬, 때로는 막무가내로 헤쳐나가는 느낌이었는데, 이런 저의 경험을 공유하는게 어떤 분들께는 도움이 되지 않을까 싶어 공유해 봅니다.\n목표설정 취업을 할까 포닥을 할까 모호한 고민만 하다가 어느새 4월 중순이 되어서야 해외 IT 회사로 직장을 구하겠다는 목표가 설정되었습니다. 그제서야 든 생각은 너무 늦었다, 준비가 부족하다, 하는 것이었습니다.","title":"My Job Interview Record (2019 summer)"},{"content":"이번 여름 졸업을 앞두고 구직 활동을 한 결과, 얼마전 운좋게도 미국에 본사를 두고 있는 한 글로벌 IT 기업의 커널/하이퍼바이저 팀으로부터 잡 오퍼를 받았습니다. 취업을 향한 한걸음 한걸음이 어둠 속을 더듬더듬, 때로는 막무가내로 헤쳐나가는 느낌이었는데, 이런 저의 경험을 공유하는게 어떤 분들께는 도움이 되지 않을까 싶어 공유해 봅니다.\n목표설정 취업을 할까 포닥을 할까 모호한 고민만 하다가 어느새 4월 중순이 되어서야 해외 IT 회사로 직장을 구하겠다는 목표가 설정되었습니다. 그제서야 든 생각은 너무 늦었다, 준비가 부족하다, 하는 것이었습니다. 취업을 위해 뭐 하나 준비한게 없더라구요.\n일단은 졸업 후 국내에서 취업 준비를 탄탄히 해서 내년 봄 시즌에 해외 글로벌 IT 기업에 취업하는걸 목표로 하되, 당장 취업 준비를 시작하고 붙을 가능성은 없겠지만 볼 수 있는 면접은 연습삼아서라도 보기로 마음을 먹었습니다.\n취업을 위한 준비 가장 시급한 건 영어 듣기 능력이었습니다. 토발즈의 인터뷰와 키노트, 리눅스 파운데이션 주최 컨퍼런스 발표들과 리눅스를 주제로 한 팟캐스트 등을 mp3 로 추출해 매일 출퇴근 길에 들었습니다.\n코딩 테스트를 연습하기 위해서는 유명한 cracking the coding interview 책도 읽어보고, 이 즈음에 우연히 지인에게 소개받은 leetcode 라는 사이트를 통해 코딩 문제도 풀어보기 시작했습니다. 작년 무렵 지인을 통해 cracking the coding interview 책을 이용한 오프라인 스터디도 진행했는데, 그 경험이 큰 도움이 되었습니다.

From the writing of this post, it had some changes, so below content, especially the test setup and running will not work. Recommend you to refer to the official document in the kernel for detailed tutorial. It also has a python version dependency now, so you would encounter a problem with Ubuntu 16.04. Recommend you to use later Python or Ubuntu 18.04 instead.\nI have attended FAST'19 last February. There was Ted Tso. I saw he hanging out with a few of Redhat people who I met during the lunch and tagged along with them. During the chat, we talked about test and Ted introduced us a testing framework called KUnit. I started using it after return from FAST'19 and felt it is amazing, so I would like to introduce it in this post.\nAs its name intimates, KUnit is a unit test framework for the Linux kernel. Google\u0026rsquo;s Brendan Higgins is developing it and he is also sending RFC patches to LKML so that it can be merged into the mainline. Because he is a Googler, he is hosting a source tree on a Google server and also made a well written Documentation.\nThis post will further briefly summarise how you can use KUnit. I tested this post on my Ubuntu 16.04 server.\nInstall You can receive Kunit development kernel from https://kunit.googlesource.com. Clone it with below simple command. I will use 5.0-rc5 based version which Brendan has recently sent the RFC patches.\n$ git clone -b kunit/rfc/5.0-rc5/v4 https://kunit.googlesource.com/linux Of course, you can get only patches via Patchwork and apply it on your kernel. I got it and applied it on my v5.0 kernel and it worked well.\nNow you should install some packages for KUnit. You need only the packages that required by kernel build. For the list of the packages, refer to the post describing it.\nTest It\u0026rsquo;s almost ready. Let\u0026rsquo;s run the example tests that kunit provides.\nFirst, you should write a file named kunitconfig under the kernel tree root directory. This file specifies what tests you want to run. Just write as below for now:\n$ cd linux $ echo CONFIG_KUNIT=y \u0026gt; kunitconfig $ echo CONFIG_KUNIT_TEST=y \u0026gt;\u0026gt; kunitconfig $ echo CONFIG_KUNIT_EXAMPLE_TEST=y \u0026gt;\u0026gt; kunitconfig Now you can run the KUnit example tests as below:\n$ ./tools/testing/kunit/kunit.py You will see results below on your terminal:\n[11:31:47] Building KUnit Kernel ...

It says example tests including kunit-resource-test, kunit-try-catch-test, string-stream-tets, example has ran, and all of those passed.\nKUnit should also build the kernel for the test, and the build takes a few of time. In this case, it took 26 seconds. That said, this was long because it\u0026rsquo;s first build. It took about only 10 seconds for me when I modified only one file after. Also, it takes very short time only for running actual test. In this case, it took only 0.27 seconds! Therefore, it will not take too huge time even though you have lots of tests.\nRefer to the Kunit official document to know how you can add your unit test. Not so hard :)\nConclusion Introduced the unit test framework for the Linux kernel, KUnit. I am also using it for my recent programming and could feel the advantage of TDD again.

Termux 등을 사용하면 셸도 원활하게 사용할 수 있습니다. 업스트림 리눅스 커널을 직접 빌드해 설치하려면 까다롭긴 하지만 불가능한 것도 아니긴 합니다.\n한가지 치명적인 건 운영체제 업데이트가 원활치 않아 보이는군요. 가격을 생각해야 하니 나온지 오래된 모델들을 알아봤는데 하나같이 운영체제 업데이트가 되지 않고 있는 듯 했습니다.\n크롬북 그렇게 이번에도 아이쇼핑만 하고 그만두려던 차에 크롬북이 눈에 들어왔습니다. 크롬북은 안드로이드보다 훨씬 개방적인 정책을 취한 오픈소스 운영체제인 크롬 OS 를 사용하고 있습니다. 리눅스 커널 기반이고, 최근들어 안드로이드 앱과 리눅스 네이티브 앱을 공식 지원하고 있습니다. 구글 정책상 대부분의 크롬 OS 디바이스가 최신 OS로 업데이트 됩니다. 과거에 잠시 셋업만 해봤는데 crouton 등을 사용하면 Ubuntu 등의 리눅스 배포판을 설치할 수 있고 Chrome OS 와의 전환도 키 하나만 누르면 되어서 매우 간편했던 기억이 있습니다. 문제라면 폼팩터가 랩톱의 폼팩터라는 것인데, 요즘 나오는 크롬북은 디스플레이를 360도 전환할 수 있어 태블릿 모드와 텐트 모드를 사용할 수 있는 제품이 대부분입니다. 가격도 매우 저렵한게 특징입니다.\n이거다 싶었습니다!\n크롬북 플러스 그렇게 크롬북 모델들을 찾아보니 삼성 크롬북 플러스[1] 가 눈에 들어왔습니다. 12.3인치 화면에 2400x1600 해상도. 책 읽기에 딱 적절해 보입니다. 스타일러스 펜도 있고, 6코어 프로세서는 ARM 프로세서지만 제게는 차고 넘쳐 보이더군요. 한가지 걸리는건 브랜드와 가격. 삼성에 대해 안좋은 인식이 있습니다. 그리고 가격이 약 450 달러. 한국에서 사려면 대략 50만원을 넘습니다. 40만원 미만을 원하던 걸 생각하면 가격이 조금 셉니다.\n최종 구입 혹시나 하고 아마존에서 크롬북 프로 검색을 해봤습니다. 중고 모델은 350불 정도 하는군요. 어차피 보조 디바이스라 중고인건 괜찮은데 가격이 여전히 좀 그렇군요. 망설이며 며칠을 보내다가 새로고침을 해보니 가격이 250불이 되어 있었습니다. 아마존은 이런식으로 핫딜이 있다고 하는군요. 이때가 아니면 언제 지르랴, 하고 질렀습니다.\n[1] https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromebooks/12-14/xe513c24-k01us-xe513c24-k01us/\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/chromebook-plus-purchase/","summary":"크롬북을 구매했습니다. 구매 결정 과정부터 사용기까지 내용을 정리해볼까 합니다. 이번 글에서는 크롬북을 구매하기까지의 고민과 과정을 정리합니다.\n기본적으로 저는 글을 읽는걸 좋아하기도 하고 읽어야만 하기도 합니다. 그러다보니 여행을 가더라도 항상 어떤 책을 들고갈까 고르는게 설레기도 하지만 짜증나기도 하고, 마음만 앞서서 캐리어 무게를 책으로 꽉 채우기도 합니다. 그래서 예전부터 이북을 고려해 봤지만 너무 반응속도가 느리기도 하고 인쇄된 것에 비해선 가독성도 떨어지고 그 특유의 책을 넘겨가며 보는 반응은 아닌 것 같아 구매하지 않고 있었습니다.","title":"Chromebook Plus Purchase (크롬북 플러스 구매 결정기)"},{"content":"A paper about GCMA project has accepted to a top-level computer science journal, Transactions on Computers[1].

Torvalds의 작업 이력을 알아낼 수 있는 유일한 방법은 전체 릴리즈 버전 사이의 거대한 diff 를 통하는 것 뿐이었습니다.\n이는 오픈소스 리비전 컨트롤 시스템이 없기 때문은 아니었습니다. 1980년대부터 CVS 가 있었고, 그 당시에도 가장 유명한 시스템이었습니다. 그 핵심 기능을 사용해서 기여자들이 패치를 중앙 저장소에 보낼 수 있었고 그 저장소로 들어가는 패치의 기록을 조사할 수 있었습니다.\n하지만 CVS 에 대한 많은 불만이 있었습니다. 그 중 하나는 변경 사항을 파일별로 제공하고 커다란 패치는 하나의 버전으로 인식할 수 없어서, 다른 개발자들로부터의 과거의 기여를 해석하기가 어려웠습니다. 또한, 두개의 같은 파일을 수정하는 패치가 동시에 보내졌을 때 발생하는 레이스 컨디션 같은 고치기 어려운 버그들도 일부 있었습니다.\nLinus는 CVS 를 좋아하지 않았는데, 부분적으로는 다른 사람들의 불만과 같은 이유 때문이었고 부분적으로는 후에야 명확해진 그만의 이유 때문이었습니다. 그는 CVS 의 버그와 이상한 기능들을 해결하려는 목표를 가지고 2000년대 초부터 발전되어온 오픈소스 프로젝트인 SVN 도 좋아하지 않았습니다.\n많은 리눅스 커널 개발자들이 적당한 리비전 컨트롤의 부재에 불만족스러 했으며, 따라서 Linus가 사용 가능한 리비전 컨트롤 중에서 뭐든 하나를 고르길 바라는 커뮤니티로부터의 압력이 항상 있었습니다. 그리고, 2002년, Linus는 그렇게 했습니다. 충격적이고 당황스럽게도, Linus는 Larry McVoy 에 의해 운영되는 BitMover 라는 회사에 의해 개발된, 소스코드가 공개되어있지 않은 상업용 시스템인 BitKeeper 를 선택했습니다.\n리눅스 커널은 역사상 가장 중요한 오픈소스 프로젝트였고, Linus 그 스스로가 수십년간 다른 오픈소스 프로젝트들이 따라하게 되었고 지금까지도 그렇게 하고 있는 오픈소스 개발 방법을 처음으로 발견한 사람이었습니다. Linus가 무슨 생각을 하는 거지? 어떻게 그가 그의 커뮤니티와 오픈소스 세계를 이렇게 배신할수가 있지? 이게 Linus가 처음 커널 개발에 BitKeeper 를 사용했을 때 대부분의 반응이었습니다.\n또한, BitMover 는 돈을 받지 않고 BitKeeper 를 사용할 수 있는 라이센스를 제공하는데 대한 대가로 리눅스 커뮤니티에 제한을 걸었습니다. 첫째, 리눅스 개발자들은 BitKeeper 를 사용하는 동안 다른 경쟁 리비전 컨트롤 시스템 개발 프로젝트에 참여할 수 없었습니다. 둘째, BitMover 는 라이센스에 대한 악용을 막기 위해 커널 프로젝트에 관계된 일부 메타데이터를 제어할 수 있었습니다. 이 메타데이터에 대한 접근이 불가능하면, 커널 개발자들은 다른 리비전 컨트롤 시스템에서의 중요한 표준적 기능인, 과거의 커널 버전들 사이의 비교를 할 수 없었습니다.\nLinus가 BitKeeper 를 사용한지 수년이 지나도 논쟁은 줄어들지 않았습니다. 그의 기본적 주장은, 그는 프리 소프트웨어 (Free Software) 광신도가 아니라는 것이었습니다. 그는 오픈소스 도구들이 같은 일을 하는 상업용 도구들에 비해 낫다면 그걸 사용할 거라고 했습니다. 하지만 상업용 도구가 더 낫다면, 그는 다른 도구를 고려하지 않을 거라고요.\n하지만, 많은 커널 개발자들이 실제로 프리 소프트웨어 광신도였습니다. 커뮤니티에 손상을 입히고 리눅스 커널 프로젝트의 fork 를 일으킬 만큼은 아니지만 Linus와 다른 개발자들간의 분노와 긴장이 심해졌습니다. Alan Cox, Al Viro, David Miller, Andrea Arcangeli, Andrew Morton 과 많은 수의 다른 사람들이 경쟁 프로젝트를 이끌만한 기술력을 가지고 있음이 분명했고, 심지어 일부는 상당수 커널 개발자들을 그들 쪽으로 끌어갈 명성을 가지고 있었습니다. 하지만 아무도 그러지 않았습니다. 이 긴장과 적대는 계속 유지되었습니다.\nBitKeeper 의 무엇이 그리 대단했을까요? BitKeeper 에서 자랑한 건 분산시스템을 제공한다는 것으로, 모든 저장소가 쉽게 fork 되고 merge 될 수 있었습니다. 이게 핵심이었습니다. 이를 통해, 특정 하위 그룹의 커널 개발자들은 리비전 컨트롤의 이득을 얻으면서 그룹끼리 독자적으로 협업하고, 준비된 다음에 그들의 변경 사항을 Linus에게 전달할 수 있었습니다. 이를 통해, 전에는 Linus 한명의 어깨에 완전히 매여있던 수많은 작업이 Linus가 믿는 개발자들, 또는 그렇게 작업하기로 한 그룹들에게 분산될 수 있었습니다. 아키텍쳐별 코드, 드라이버, 그리고 커널의 하위 시스템들이 모두 어떻게든 독립적으로 개발되고, 이후 적절한 시점에 한번에 메인 커널에 병합될 수 있었습니다.\n슬슬 하는 이야기가 익숙하게 들릴 겁니다만, 2002년에 이건 새로운 아이디어였습니다. CVS 와 Subversion 같은 당시 존재하던 프로젝트들에서 fork 와 merge 는 주인만 할 수 있고, 죽고 싶도록 시간이 오래 걸리는 작업이었습니다. BitKeeper 를 통해, 이게 사소한 작업이 되었습니다.\n커널 개발 도구의 핵심부에 독점 소프트웨어를 사용하려는 Linus의 의지는 많은 사람들이 대안을 만드는데 더욱 노력하게 만들었습니다. CVS 와 Subversion 프로젝트는 너무 많은 기초적 설계 오류가 있었고, 이미 너무 많이 개발이 진행되어 변경하기가 쉽지 않았습니다. 다른 프로젝트들 모두 마찬가지였습니다. 하지만 이제 그들은 Linus가 정말 원하는걸 알거나 안다고 생각했으므로, 정말로 코딩을 시작할 수 있었습니다. 그 결과 분산 개발 기능을 제공하는 많은 수의 리비전 컨트롤 시스템이 나왔습니다.\n그런 시스템들 중에 arch, darcs, 그리고 monotone 등이 있었습니다. 그들은 Bitkeeper 를 경쟁 상대라고 함으로써, Linus가 Bitkeeper 에 대한 대안으로 그들을 선택하라고 설득했습니다.\n많은 사람들이 시도했지만, 아무도 성공하지 못했습니다. 이는 부분적으로는 Linus가 CVS 와 Subversion 에 뭐가 빠져있는지 모두 이야기 하지 않았듯, 그 프로젝트들에 Linus가 더 필요로 하는 것이 무엇인지 모두 말하지 않았기 때문입니다. 그리고, Linus가 소스가 폐쇄된 도구를 사용하는것도 개의치 않는 것 같았으므로, 어떤 대안이 그에게 받아들여질만 하려면 그 대안은 BitKeeper 보다 훨씬 기술적으로 향상되어 있어야만 할 것이었습니다. 따라서, BitKeeper 전에도 오픈소스 툴의 기능은 충분하지 않았지만, BitKeeper 가 나타남으로써 오픈소스 툴이 맞춰야 할 기능의 목표가 더욱 높아진 셈입니다.\n수년간의 많은 노력 후에도, 어떤 오픈소스 대안도 Linus의 필요를 맞추기엔 CVS 나 Subversion 보다도 크게 나아지지 못했습니다. 만약 Samba 를 만들었고 rsync 의 공동 창시자인 Andrew Tridgell 이 아니었더라면 이 상황은 훨씬 오래 지속될 수 있었을 겁니다. 2005년, Andrew는 프리 소프트웨어인 대안을 만들기 위해 BitKeeper 네트워킹 프로토콜을 리버스 엔지니어링 하려 했습니다. 그가 아니었더라도, 누군가는 시도했을 겁니다 - 그건 그저 시간 문제였습니다. Larry McVoy 는 누구든 이 시도를 했다면 당장 지원을 끊겠다고 리눅스 개발자들에게 경고했고, 실제로 그렇게 했습니다. 결국, 급작스럽게 BitKeeper 를 커널 개발에 사용될 수 없게 되었습니다. 전체 개발 도구와 분산 버전 컨트롤로부터 생겨난 개발 문화는 앞날을 알 수 없는 상황에 놓였습니다.\n이게 무슨 의미일까요? Linus는 그의 과거 방식의 개발로 돌아가서 모든 패치를 그 자신에게 보내라고 했을까요? 그렇지 않다면, BitKeeper 의 오픈소스 대안들 가운데 하나를 선택했을까요? 만약 그가 그랬다면, 어떤 대안을 골랐을까요?\n이 시점에서, 놀라운 일이 발생했습니다. Linus가 리눅스 커널 개발을 1991년 시작한 후 처음으로 작업을 완전히 멈췄습니다. 현존하는 어떤 도구도 그가 원하는 일을 해주지 못했으므로, 그는 자신의 것을 만들기로 결정했습니다.\nLinus의 주요 관심은, 사실 속도였습니다. 이것이 그가 기존에는 완전히, 적어도 현존하는 프로젝트들이 이해할 수 있는 방식으로는 이야기하지 않은 부분이었습니다. 전세계에서 전력을 다해 패치를 보내오는 수천명의 커널 개발자들을 위해, 그는 기존에는 상상할 수 없는 속도로 동작하는 무언가가 필요했습니다. 그는 가장 거대하고 가장 복잡한 작업이라 해도 완료하는데 몇초 이상 기다리는 걸 참을 수 없었습니다. Arch 도, darcs, monotone 도, 그리고 어떤 다른 프로젝트도 이 요구사항을 맞추지 못했습니다.\nLinus는 잠시 은둔한 채 코딩을 했고, 그 후에 그의 새로운 계획을 세상에 알렸습니다. 2005년 6월에 그 프로젝트를 시작한 이래 몇일만에, Linus의 git 리비전 컨트롤 시스템은 git 소스코드의 리비전 컨트롤을 완전히 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 몇주 후, git 은 리눅스 커널 개발의 리비전 컨트롤을 맡을 준비가 되었습니다. 몇달 후, 완전한 기능을 갖추었습니다. 이 시점에서, Linus는 이 프로젝트의 관리 권한을 해당 프로젝트의 가장 열정적인 기여자, Junio C. Hamano 에게 넘기고 리눅스 개발에 다시 전념했습니다.\n이 도구에 놀란 프리 소프트웨어 개발자 커뮤니티는 이 괴상한 작업물을 이해하려 노력했습니다. 이것은 리비전 컨트롤 소프트웨어의 어떤 것도 닮지 않았습니다. 사실, 이것은 리비전 컨트롤 시스템보다는 낮은 단계의 파일시스템 오퍼레이션들의 집합에 가까워 보였습니다. 그리고 다른 시스템들이 패치를 저장하는 것과 달리, 이것은 각각의 변경된 파일의 버전을 모두 저장했습니다. 어떻게 이런 방식이 괜찮을 수 있을까요? 하지만, 이 도구는 fork 와 merge 를 번개같은 속도로 처리할 수 있고, 패치를 요청하자마자 만들어낼 수 있었습니다.\n점진적으로, Junio는 CVS 와 Subversion 의 것들을 닮은 높은 수준의 커맨드 집합을 만들었습니다. Git 의 원래 커맨드들이 \u0026ldquo;배관\u0026rdquo; 이었다면, 새로운 커맨드들은 \u0026ldquo;도자기 제품\u0026rdquo; 이었습니다. 그리고, 결국 사용되게 되었습니다.\nBitKeeper 에 대한 논쟁과 분노가 있었던 만큼이나, git 의 계속된 개발을 향한 열망과 참여 의지가 많았습니다. 포팅, 확장 기능, 그리고 웹사이트들이 모든 것을 현재 상태로 끌어올렸습니다. 몇년만에, 거의 모든 사람들이 git 을 사용하게 되었습니다. 리눅스처럼, git 이 세상을 집어삼켰습니다.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/git_origin_story_ko/","summary":"최근 흥미롭게 보았던 Git Origin Story

주도적입니다. 여러 개인 또는 단체가 커널을 각자의 방식으로 테스트 하고 그 결과를 공유합니다. 인텔에서는 0-day 서비스[1] 라는 서비스를 자체적으로 돌리는데, 이 서비스는 최신 리눅스 커널을 가져다가 빌드하고 다양한 기능 / 성능 테스트를 돌리고 그 결과 발견된 regression 을 LKML 에 메일로 보내주는 일을 합니다. 말하자면 Continuous Integration (CI) 이죠.\nLinux Kernel Performance (LKP) Tests[2] 는 0-day 서비스에서 기능 / 성능 테스트를 수행하는데 사용되는 도구입니다. 다양한 테스트를 돌리기 위한 시스템 환경 구성, 테스트 프로그램과 그 종속 프로그램 / 라이브러리의 설치와 환경 구성, 테스트 수행과 결과 정리, 그리고 테스트 진행 사이의 시스템 상태 프로파일링 및 프로파일링 결과 정리를 대신해 줍니다. 0-day 서비스에 연결되어 있지만 lkp-tests 와 0-day 서비스 사이의 종속성이 없으며, 오픈소스 프로젝트로 개발이 진행되고 있어 그 소스코드를 누구나 사용할 수 있으며 개인이 사용하기에도 편리하게 되어 있어서 개인 개발자가 자신의 패치를 테스트할 목적으로 사용하기에도 좋습니다. 이 글에서는 이러한 lkp-tests 의 구조와 사용법을 간단히 설명합니다. 전체적으로 인텔의 관련 블로그 글[3] 을 참고했습니다.\n설치 먼저 다음 커맨드로 lkp-tests 소스코드를 얻어옵니다:\n$ git clone https://github.com/intel/lkp-tests $ cd lkp-tests 그리고 lkp-tests 자체를 설치.\n$ sudo make install 이 커맨드는 단순히 지금 소스코드를 땡겨온 lkp-tests 소스코드 디렉토리의 bin/lkp 파일을 링크하는 /usr/local/bin/lkp 심볼릭 링크를 만들 뿐입니다. 따라서 셸에서 lkp 커맨드를 쓸 수 있게 해주죠. 이 lkp 파일이 결국 lkp-tests 의 대부분의 일을 해주는 핵심 커맨드입니다. 이 프로그램의 간단한 사용법은 다음과 같이 확인할 수 있습니다:\n$ lkp Usage: lkp \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; [options] INSTALLATION install JOB install binary dependencies for JOB JOB split JOB split JOB matrix compile JOB compile JOB into shell script TESTING run JOB run test JOB locally qemu JOB run test JOB in QEMU virtual machine RESULT result|rt|_rt|__rt PATTERNs show result dirs ls|ll PATTERNs ls

pry with lib/*.rb loaded More commands can be found in /home/sjpark/lkp-tests/{bin,sbin,tools}/ 여기서 \u0026lt;command\u0026gt; 는 lkp-tests 소스코드 디렉토리 아래 bin/, sbin/, tools/, 또는 lkp-exec/ 아래 위치한 실행파일로, lkp 는 단순히 그 실행파일을 수행하면서 인자를 넘길 뿐입니다.\n테스트에 필요한 소프트웨어 설치 다음 커맨드는 lkp-tests 가 의존하고 있는 기본적 소프트웨어 패키지들을 모두 설치합니다:\n$ sudo lkp install Ubuntu 16.04 에서는 다음 패키지들을 까는군요:\nbc gawk gzip kmod time automake bison bsdtar build-essential bzip2 ca-certificates cpio fakeroot flex gcc git libc6-dev libc6-dev:i386 libklibc-dev libtool linux-libc-dev linux-libc-dev:i386 linux-tools-generic make openssl patch rsync ruby ruby-dev wget lkp-tests 내부 벤치마크 실행 이제 lkp-tests 에서 지원하는 벤치마크를 실제로 돌려봅시다.\n테스트 수행에 필요한 환경 설정 실제 테스트를 돌리기 위해선 벤치마크를 깔고, 그 벤치마크가 사용하는 패키지를 깔고, 테스트에 사용될 도구들을 깔고, 여러 설정을 하는등의 작업이 필요합니다.\n다음 명령은 lkp-tests 에서 ebizzy 라는 벤치마크를 사용하는 테스트를 위해 필요한 프로그램들을 설치하고 수행 환경을 준비합니다.\n$ sudo lkp install jobs/ebizzy.yaml job lkp-tests 에서 테스트 수행의 기본 단위는 job 이라고 이야기 하는데, jobs/ 디렉토리 아래에 각 job 을 설명한 yaml 파일이 있습니다. 위의 커맨드에서 인자로 넣은 ebizzy.yaml 은 ebizzy 를 사용한 테스트에 필요한 사항들이 들어있습니다. 이 커맨드는 내부적으로 이 테스트에 필요한 패키지를 설치하고 ebizzy 벤치마크도 소스코드를 인터넷에서 받아다가 컴파일해 설치합니다.\nJob 파일은 또한 해당 테스트가 어떤 시스템 환경들에서 어떤 벤치마크를 어떤 인자를 줘가며 수행해야할지 등에 대한 내용을 담고 있습니다. 예컨대 jobs/aim7-fs-1brd.yaml job 은 xfs, ext4, btrfs, f2fs 파일 시스템 각각에 대해 aim7 을 돌려보도록 되어 있습니다.\n테스트 수행 다음 명령은 ebizzy job 으로 기술된 테스트를 실제 수행시킵니다:\n$ sudo lkp run jobs/ebizzy.yaml job 쪼개기 ebizzy.yaml 은 시스템 소유 CPU 코어 갯수 2배 갯수의 쓰레드를 사용해 ebizzy 를 10초간 돌리는 실험을 100번 반복하도록 되어 있습니다. 즉, 실험의 경우의 수가 하나입니다. 그러나, 앞서 설명한 aim7-fs-1brd 와 같이 다양한 구성을 사용하게 되어 있는 경우, 한가지 구성에 대해서만 반복 실험을 하고 싶을 수 있을 겁니다. 이런 경우 다음 명령으로 job 을 쪼갤 수 있습니다:\n$ sudo lkp split jobs/ebizzy.yaml 이 커맨드는 인자로 넣은 job 파일을 쪼개서 현재 디렉토리에 쪼개진 job 파일들을 저장합니다. 어떤 구성이 쪼개졌는지는 파일 이름으로 볼 수 있습니다. ebizzy.yaml 을 쪼개면 ebizzy-200%-100x-10s.yaml 라는 이름의 한개의 job 파일이 생성됩니다. 앞서 이야기한 aim7-fs-1brd.yaml 을 쪼개면 다음과 같이 많은 수의 job 이 생성됩니다:\naim7-fs-1brd-1BRD_48G-btrfs-creat-clo-4.yaml aim7-fs-1brd-1BRD_48G-f2fs-creat-clo-1500.yaml

디렉토리로의 심볼릭 링크를 만들어 줍니다.\nConclusion 이렇게 lkp-tests 가 무엇인지, 그리고 어떻게 사용할 수 있는지 알아봤습니다. 이제, 리눅스 커널 개발 커뮤니티에서 사용하는 리그레션 테스트를 여러분의 환경에서도 손쉽게 돌려볼 수 있습니다.\nReferences [1]

I also do not prefer such use of debuggers, but admit that sometimes debuggers are quite useful. ;)\nThere are several ways to debug Linux kernel, but one of above is to set up a Linux virtual machine using QEMU and debugging the Linux kernel of the virtual machine from the host machine. This post summarises how to debug the Linux kernel in this way.\nTest Environment The versions and names of the software I used for test of this post are as below.\nUbuntu 16.04.3 Server gdb 7.11.1 QEMU v2.11.0-dirty Linux v4.16 Kernel Build First, build the kernel you want to debug. You should turn CONFIG_GDB_SCRIPTS on, turn CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED off, and turn CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER on if your target architecture supports it.\nBoot The Virtual Machine If your kernel is ready, boot a QEMU vertual machine with it. You could do it in several ways. For example, you could install the kernel on the virtual machine disk. Or, you could use -kernel, -append and -initrd QEMU option to boot the virtual machine with your kernel image in host machine directly, or some other ways. One thing you should keep in your mind is that you should turn kaslr off. Just giving nokaslr in the kernel parameter doesn\u0026rsquo;t works well.\nPass -s option to QEMU when you start up the QEMU virtual machine, or enter gdbserver in the QEMU monitor console command line. This make the virtual machine to start gdbserver and wait on tcp::1234 for some accesses. If you have given -nographic QEMU option and set the kernel parameter so that the virtual machine\u0026rsquo;s console is connected to your terminal, you could not see the QEMU monitor console directly. In this case, you can go back to QEMU monitor console by entering Ctrl+a c. If you want to go back to the virtual machine\u0026rsquo;s console again, Ctrl+a c \u0026lt;enter\u0026gt;.\nStart gdb Move to the build directory of the kernel to debug, enter gdb vmlinux. This will start up gdb using the symbol and debuggin information of the kernel. Ubuntu or some distributions might fail to read vmlinux-gdb.py. The error message also show you how you can fix it, but in summary, you should append below one line at the end of the .gdbinit file and start the gdb again with the above command:\nadd-auto-load-state-path /path/to/linux-build Now, connect to the QEMU virtual machine by entering below command from the gdb session:\n(gdb) target remote :1234 Remote debugging using :1234 0xffffffff818cce92 in native_safe_halt () at /home/sjpark/linux/arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h:54 54 asm volatile(\u0026#34;sti; hlt\u0026#34;: : :\u0026#34;memory\u0026#34;); Just after you entering this command, QEMU virtual machine will be frozen. From now, you can see the variables of the kernel, set the breakpoint, execute the code step by step, as you normally did with gdb and user space programs. For example, you can set breakpoint to specific function as below:\n(gdb) b cma_alloc Breakpoint 1 at 0xffffffff81240f10: file /home/hacklog/linux/mm/cma.c, line 399. If you want your virtual machine to run again, you can enter c. This will resume the execution of the kernel. If you set a breakpoint as described above and if the code is be executed, the execution will be started on the breakpoint.\n(gdb) c Continuing. If you want the kernel to stop again, enter Ctrl+C in the gdb.\n^C Thread 1 received signal SIGINT, Interrupt. 0xffffffff818cce92 in native_safe_halt () at /home/sjpark/linux/arch/x86/include/asm/irqflags.h:54 54 asm volatile(\u0026#34;sti; hlt\u0026#34;: : :\u0026#34;memory\u0026#34;); (gdb) Use Linux gdb helper Actually, you can normally use gdb even though it failed to load vmlinux-gdb.py. The python script contains some helper scripts for more convenient kernel debugging on the gdb. You can do kernel debugging a little bit more conveniently if you use it.\nList of the helper scripts The helper scripts have lx prefix. You can list up their names and brief descriptions as below:\n(gdb) apropos lx function lx_current -- Return current task function lx_module -- Find module by name and return the module variable function lx_per_cpu -- Return per-cpu variable function lx_task_by_pid -- Find Linux task by PID and return the task_struct variable function lx_thread_info -- Calculate Linux thread_info from task variable function lx_thread_info_by_pid -- Calculate Linux thread_info from task variable found by pid lx-cmdline -- Report the Linux Commandline used in the current kernel lx-cpus -- List CPU status arrays lx-dmesg -- Print Linux kernel log buffer lx-fdtdump -- Output Flattened Device Tree header and dump FDT blob to the filename lx-iomem -- Identify the IO memory resource locations defined by the kernel lx-ioports -- Identify the IO port resource locations defined by the kernel lx-list-check -- Verify a list consistency lx-lsmod -- List currently loaded modules lx-mounts -- Report the VFS mounts of the current process namespace lx-ps -- Dump Linux tasks lx-symbols -- (Re-)load symbols of Linux kernel and currently loaded modules lx-version -- Report the Linux Version of the current kernel So easy, huh? ;)\nReferences The Kernel Official Document for the Kernel Debugging A blog article The gdbserver official document ","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/qemu_kernel_debugging/","summary":"You can use classical debugger for your Linux kernel programming, though Torvalds doesn\u0026rsquo;t like it.

Amber, Dark, 그리고 IPA. 호박은 좋아하지 않으므로 Dark 와 IPA 를 한잔씩, 그리고 안주로 야채 샐러드를 주문했습니다. 가장 싼 안주이긴 하지만, 맥주 포함해서 가격은 한국돈으로 2만원이 안됩니다. 프라하의 물가에 건배하며 맥주를 마셔봅니다.\n하지만 10월 말인데다 해가 이미 졌고 산위라 그런지 찬바람이 마구 들어옵니다. 오들오들 떨면서도 천천히 다 마셨습니다. 다 마시고 계산하려 하는데 맥주 더 마시겠냐고 하더군요. 맘같아서야 그러고 싶지만 추워서 \u0026ldquo;no thanks\u0026rdquo; 이야기 하고 나왔습니다.\nBack to Old Town of Prague ![foo] (/img/osse_03/26.jpg)\n![foo]

물보다 싸니까 맥주 많이 마시라고. 전 지역 주민의 충고를 잘 받아들입니다 하하), 체코에서의 매일밤 마무리는 맥주와 함께 해야겠다고 생각했습니다. 그래서 점심에 심카드 사면서 봐두었던 마트에 가서 소세지와 맥주를 사왔습니다. 소세지는 앞의 포스트에서 사진으로도 올려뒀던 소세지 진열대에서 사왔는데, 무게를 재고 가격표를 붙여야 하는데 이걸 해주는 여성분은 영어를 못하시는 것 같더군요. 바디랭귀지로 주문하는데 뭔가 짜증을\u0026hellip; 가장 저렴한 편인 소세지를 샀습니다. 한 조각에 한국돈으로 오백원 정도밖에 안합니다. 우리나라에서 오백원이면 천하장사 소세지 젓가락굵기만한거나 살텐데, 역시 체코 물가 리스펙트합니다. 소세지 맛은 좀 짠 편인데 전 짠걸 잘 먹기도 하거니와, 짠만큼 맥주를 더 마시면 덜 짭니다.\n체코하면 필스너라는 인식이 있는 것 같은데 저 염소 맥주라고도 불리는 Kozel 맥주도 유명하다고 하더군요. 왠지 염소가 맘에 들어 샀는데, 한국돈으로 천원이 안됩니다. 맛은 탁월.\n이렇게 호스텔 휴게공간에서 맥주에 소세지를 함께 하며 하루를 마무리 합니다.\n하루동안 새삼 느낀게, 한국인 여행객이 정말 많더군요. 한시간 이상 한국말 못들은 경우가 많지 않은 거 같습니다. 호스텔에서도 꽤 많은 한국인이 있어서 휴게 공간에서 맥주 마시는 사이에도 앞자리에 한국인 커플과 모녀가 이야기를 나누더군요.\n이제 내일부터 OSSummit 이 시작됩니다. 어떤 흥미진진한 세션들이 있을지, 어떤 재밌는 이벤트가 준비되어 있을지, 커널 커뮤니티에서 메일로만 만났던 커널 개발자들과 만나서 어떤 이야기를 나눌지 기대하며 잠자리에 들었습니다.\n[*] 이 다음 글부터는 OSSummit 이야기가 본격적으로 시작됩니다. 거꾸로, 프라하 여행 정보는 거의 없을 겁니다.\nReferences [1] https://ko.wikipedia.org/wiki/%EB%B8%94%ED%83%80%EB%B0%94_%EA%B0%95\n[2]

E-SATA 로 등록을 해야 하고, 언젠가부터 E-SATA 등록비도 몇만원 정도 생겼죠. 또, 미국은 입국심사가 왠지 날카롭다는 인상입니다. 입국할 때 입국심사 카드도 써야하고 여기 숙소 주소 등도 적어야 하고, 지문도 찍어야 하죠. 공항 보안검색대에선 투시카메라로 사진도 찍고. 그래도 뭐 간편하게 가는 편이라 생각했었습니다만 프라하 공항에서 생각이 바뀌었습니다. 대한민국 여권 소지자는 프라하에 갈때에도 비자가 필요없습니다. 입국심사를 위한 카드 작성도 없습니다. 입국심사관은 거의 아무것도 묻질 않습니다. 숙소가 어딘지도 알릴 필요 없고, 뭐하러 왔는지 꼬치꼬치 묻지도 않습니다. 지문도 찍지 않는군요. 정말 편하다는 인상을 받았습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/18.jpg)\n공항 사진입니다. 그렇게 크진 않네요. 아담한 크기의 공항입니다. 그래도 무료 와이파이도 잘 됩니다.\n프라하는 코룬이라는 단위의 통화를 사용합니다. 유로를 받는 곳도 있다고 하지만 왠만하면 코룬을 쓰는게 좋은 것 같습니다. 한국에서도 코룬 환전이 된다고 하는데, 급하게 오느라 미리 하지 못했습니다. 다른 여행객들도 프라하에서 직접 환전하는 경우가 많다고 하는군요. 공항 환전소는 환율이 좋지 않고 시내의 일부 환전소가 괜찮으므로, 공항에서는 시내 가는 교통비 정도만 환전하고, 시내의 추천 환전소에 가서 나머지를 환전하는게 좋다는 이야기가 많더군요. 일단 교통비와 심카드 살 돈을 생각해서 3만원 정도를 환전했습니다. 코룬 환율은 당시 1 코룬당 50원 정도. 수수료를 떼고 약 540 코룬이 제게 떨어졌습니다. 역시 공항 환전은 가성비가 좋지 않네요.\nTo The Hostel 이제 환전도 했으니 숙소로 이동을 해야겠습니다. 컨퍼런스 참가 지원 여부가 늦게 발표된 만큼 숙소도 늦게 잡았습니다. 하지만 특가로 나온 방이 있어 매우 저렴하게 구할 수 있었습니다. 외국에 혼자 나가면 호스텔을 예약하는 편입니다. 저렴한 가격에 각지의 여행객과 만날 수 있어 이득보는 느낌이거든요.\n사실 호스텔에 대한 처음 인상은 별로 좋지 않았습니다. 유럽 여행 가서 호스텔에서 변태 만나고 벼룩에 고생했다는 친구의 이야기도 있었고, 처음 이용했던 호스텔은 2014년에 Google I/O 가서 이용해 봤는데, 방도 엄청 좁고 시설이 열악했거든요. 하지만 두번째로 암스테르담에서 이용했던 호스텔 이후 인식이 완전 바뀌었습니다. 넓고 인테리어도 좋고 함께 방을 썼던 친구들도 유쾌해서 매우 즐거웠던 경험이었습니다.\n어쨌든 이번에 구한 숙소는 프라하 중심가에 위치한 호스텔. 그 가격에 이런 위치라니 시설이 얼마나 안좋길래 이렇게 나머지 조건이 좋은 걸까 걱정이 되기도 했습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/19.jpg)\n프라하에서는 버스, 지하철, 트램 등이 모두 하나의 교통권을 사용합니다. 교통권은 사용 시간대별로 가격이 매겨지며, 그 시간 내에는 환승이 모두 무료. 즉, 30분짜리 교통권을 사면 버스를 한대 타든 두대 타든 지하철을 갈아타든 30분 내에는 추가로 돈을 지불할 일이 없습니다. 전 119번 버스를 타고 나가서 지하철을 타고 시내로 이동할 계획입니다. 구글맵이 그렇게 추천했거든요. 구글맵은 약 40분 걸린다고 이야기 하는군요. 교통권 자판기에서 90분짜리를 뽑습니다. 32 코룬입니다. 한국돈으로 약 1,600원이군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/20.jpg)\n뽑은 교통권입니다. 유효 시간이 90분이라고 적혀 있습니다.\n공항을 나서기전 마지막으로 무료 와이파이를 이용해 필요한 정보를 최대한 미리 검색해두고 폰에 다운로드 받아둡니다. 여길 나서면 숙소에 도착하기 전까지는 인터넷이 불가능하니까요. 심각한 길치인 저로썬 큰 모험입니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/21.jpg)\n여행자들 가는길이 다 거기서 거기인지 여행자인 분들이 함께 움직입니다. 제가 프라하에 도착한 시각은 아침 9시 무렵. 전날 비가 왔는지 땅이 젖어있습니다. 일기예보로는 제가 머무르는 동안 계속 흐리고 때때로 비가 올 예정이더군요.\n프라하 버스 정류장은 모니터로 버스가 어디쯤 오고 있는지 자세히 표시됩니다. 한국 대중교통이 이런 시스템이 잘되어있기로 유명하다고 들었는데, 여긴 더 자세한 것 같다는 인상을 받았습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/22.jpg)\n도착한 버스를 탔습니다. 버스에 타면 승차권을 넣는 기계가 있는데, 거기 집어넣으면 위 사진처럼 집어넣은 시간이 찍힙니다. 표는 중간중간 검표원이 검사를 하게 되는데, 이 때 여기 찍힌 시간과 검사 시각 사이의 시간이 표에 적힌 유효시간 내인지를 보게 된다고 합니다. 버스기사는 딱히 표를 보거나 하지 않습니다. 신뢰를 기반으로 운영되는 시스템인거죠. 검표원을 만나진 못했습니다만, 무임승차 같은 짓은 하지 않기로 합시다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/23.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/24.jpg)\n버스에서 내리고 지하철 타는 길도 여행객들이 다들 우루루 움직여서 그냥 따라가도 되었습니다. 지하철도 상당히 노선이 간단해서 큰 어려움 없이 승차할 수 있었습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/25.jpg)\n지하철에서 내려 땅위로 나왔습니다. 길치가 인터넷으로부터의 실시간 도움 없이 숙소를 찾아야 하는 시간이 왔습니다. 숙소까지는 걸어서 3분 거리인데 역시 헤맸습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/26.jpg)\n길을 헤매는 와중에도 신기한 구경거리는 있습니다. 역시 프라하, 역시 시내 중심지입니다. 지나가는 관광객도 무척 많습니다. 단체 관광객, 가이드를 따라 투어중인 관광객도 많더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/27.jpg)\n그래도 어찌어찌 숙소를 찾았습니다. 호스텔이 쇼핑몰처럼 생긴 건물 안에 있더군요. 의외의 위치선정이라 많이 헤맸습니다. 체크인 수속은 먼저 밟을 수 있지만, 방 청소 시간이 남아있어서 실질 체크인은 오후 두시부터 가능합니다. 등록데스크에 짐을 맡길 수 있으므로, 짐을 맡겨두고 체크인 시간까지 좀 돌아다니기로 합니다. 하지만 먼저 등록데스크의 무료 와이파이에 붙어 최대한 주변 정보를 받아둡니다. 일단 다음 목표는 시내 통신사 대리점에 가서 심카드를 구매하는 겁니다.\nSIM Card for the Internet ![foo] (/img/osse_02/28.jpg)\n거리에선 인터넷이 안되지만 숙소 위치는 파악했고 숙소까지 가면 인터넷이 됩니다. 조금 마음이 편안해지니 주변 경치도 눈에 들어옵니다. 프라하에서 심카드를 구매할 수 있는 통신사로 보다폰, O2, 그리고 T-mobile 이 있습니다만, T-mobile 을 많이들 추천하더군요. 미국 여행 시에도 T-mobile 에서 구매해서 나름 편하게 사용했으므로 T-mobile 대리점을 찾아갔습니다. 그런데, 아뿔싸. 일요일이라 쉬는 날이네요. 숙소로 돌아가 다시 인터넷 검색을 하니 좀 떨어진 위치에 큰 쇼핑몰이 있고 거기에 T-mobile 대리점이 있습니다. 조금 먼 길이라 인터넷 없이 찾아가려니 걱정되지만 일단 출발합니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/29.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/30.jpg)\n그래도 다운받아진 구글 지도가 있고 GPS 가 있으니 생각보다 어렵지 않게 길을 찾아갈 수 있었습니다. 점원 분께 여행자고 심카드를 구매하고자 한다고 하니 능숙하게 안내를 해주시는군요.\n\u0026ldquo;데이터가 필요한가요? 문자는 필요한가요?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;전 데이터만 있으면 되요!\u0026rdquo;\n통화, 문자 없이 1 GB 데이터를 LTE 속도로 30일간 사용할 수 있는 심카드를 약 200 코룬에 구매했습니다. 1 GB 데이터가 너무 많은거 아닌가 싶고 국내에서도 3G 쓰는데 LTE 가 필요한가 싶지만 이게 가장 저렴한 버전이라고 하시는군요. 생각해보면 제가 쓰는 폰인 넥서스5 는 LTE 지원함에도 국내에선 3G 데이터를 썼는데, 외국에서 오히려 LTE 써보네요. 아이러니\u0026hellip;\n개인적으로 외국 나갈때 자주 사용하는 선불심 판매소에서 파는 데이터 유심은 무제한 데이터에 대략 만원 후반대 가격인데, 200 코룬이면 약 만원이니 가성비도 나쁘지 않습니다. 심카드를 꽂고 폰을 재부팅 합니다. 도브리덴! 하는 안내문자가 날아오고 (도브리덴은 체코어로 인사말이라고 합니다), 인터넷이 됩니다. 할렐루야!\nLocal Foods of Prague 대리점을 나오니 바로 앞에 식료품 마트가 있습니다. 많은 외국은 인건비가 비싸서 그런지 음식점에서 사먹는 비용은 비싸지만 식재료는 무척 저렴해서, 직접 요리해 먹으면 우리나라보다도 훨씬 싸게 식사를 해결할 수 있는 경우가 많습니다. 때문에 저는 외국에 나오면 식료품 마트에서 먹을거리를 자주 사먹습니다. 여기가 제 식사의 대부분을 충당할 가능성이 큰 곳이므로 한번 둘러봤습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/2.jpg)\n체코하면 맥주입니다. 체코는 독일을 제치고 일인당 맥주 소비량이 가장 많은 나라입니다. 필스너 우르켈을 만든 나라이기도 하구요. 물보다도 맥주가 싼 가격인 것도 특징입니다. 정말 쌉니다. 대부분의 맥주가 한병에 한국돈으로 천원을 넘지 않습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/1.jpg)\n맥주하면 또 소세지죠! 소세지도 저렴합니다. 여행중 매일밤 여기서 맥주와 소세지를 사서 맥주 한잔씩 하며 하루를 마무리 했습니다.\nSightseeing before Check-in 이제 급한 불은 모두 껐습니다. 숙소도 찾았고, 인터넷도 되고. 하지만 아직도 오후 12시를 조금 넘긴 시간. 체크인도 오후 두시부터이고, OSSummit pre-registration 도 오후 세시부터 시작입니다. 일단 무작정 시내를 돌아다녀 보기로 하고 걸었습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/3.jpg)\n걷다보니 블타바강이 나왔습니다. 강 건너편으로 프라하 성이 아름답게 보입니다. 강변으로 산책로도 조성되어 있고, 강에 선박 레스토랑도 많습니다. 일단 강변을 따라 걸어봅니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/4.jpg)\n천천히 걷다보니 좀 시간이 흐릅니다. 슬슬 체크인 시간이 다가옵니다. 강변에서 빠져나와 숙소쪽으로 천천히 걸어갔습니다. 어디로 걷는지도 모르고 그냥 걸었는데 여기저기 멋진 게 많습니다. 알고보니 여기가 중심지더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/5.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/6.jpg)\n광장입니다. 암스테르담에 갔을때 봤던 중앙 광장이 떠올랐습니다. 사람도 많고 관광객도 많고 볼거리도 많습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/7.jpg)\n나름 유명한 시계 같더군요. 정각엔 인형들이 튀어나와서 뭔가 하고 들어간다는데 이게 몇백년된 시계라고 했던 것 같습니다. 정각에 여기 있질 않아서 인형들이 움직이는건 보지 못했습니다.ㅜㅜ\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/8.jpg)\n길치의 특성 중 하나는 자꾸 샛길로 빠지려는 본능이 있다는 점 아닐까 싶습니다. 반듯이 숙소로 가다가도 자꾸 옆길이 보이니 들어가보고 싶습니다. 장점은 그렇게 발견하는 재미진 곳이 많다는 거죠. 그렇게 발가는대로 걸어보니 재래시장 같은 곳이 나타났습니다. 먹을거리도 팔고, 꼭두각시 인형도 팔고, 기념품도 많이 있습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/9.jpg)\n기내식을 많이 먹었지만 맛깔나게 담아둔 과일이 맛있어 보이더군요. 그래도 돈이 별로 없어서 그냥 참고 지나갑니다.\nBack to the Hostel ![foo] (/img/osse_02/10.jpg)\n드디어 숙소 근처에 도착. 곧 체크인 시간입니다. 잠깐 숙소 근처 거리를 천천히 둘러봤습니다. 이제야 정신차리고 보니 숙소는 바츨라프 광장의 아래쪽에 있었더군요. 그래서인지 숙소 건물 앞 길거리에는 노점이 여럿 있고 관광객들이 거기서 먹을거리와 맥주를 즐기고 있었습니다. 시선과 후각을 강렬하게 끌어당긴 것 중 하나는 이 장작불에 빙글빙글 돌아가며 구워지는 고기! 체코 전통 요리 중 하나인 것 같은데, 주문하면 곧바로 칼로 고기를 일부분 썰어서 빵과 함께 주는 시스템 같습니다. 여기다 맥주까지 함께 판매하니, 안먹고 버티기 힘들정도로 침이 줄줄 흐르더군요. 그래도 전 환전한 돈도 얼마 안되고 해서 참았습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/11.jpg)\n어쨌든 드디어 체크인 시간이 되었으니 숙소로 들어갑니다. 제가 예약한 방은 10인 혼성 도미토리 (dormitory) 룸. 위 사진처럼 다섯개의 이층침대가 있습니다. 일찍 체크인한 덕인지 제가 첫번째인가봅니다. 창가 1층 자리를 선점했습니다. 어쩌면 이 넓은 방을 혼자 쓸수도\u0026hellip;? 했는데 밤에 다들 체크인 하더군요. 하하. 어쨌든 아주 넓진 않지만 좁지 않고 깨끗했습니다. 대만족! 잠깐 인터넷도 하고 간단히 세수도 하고, 이제 뭐할지 계획을 짜봅니다.\n내일부터 OSSummit 시작이니, 낮에 관광을 하는건 오늘이 마지막입니다. 일단 나가서 좀 돌아다녀보고, 컨퍼런스 회장으로 이동해 pre-registration 도 하고, 이어서 프라하 성을 돌아보기로 계획했습니다.\nJourney to OSSummit Pre-registration ![foo] (/img/osse_02/12.jpg)\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/13.jpg)\n가장 먼저 숙소 바로 앞의 바츨라프 광장을 둘러봤습니다. 약간 경사가 져 있어서 바츨라프 광장 끝의 동상 앞에서 뒤를 돌아보면 프라하 시내가 보이는 경치가 좋더군요. 바츨라프 광장은 서울 광화문 광장과 비슷한데, 민주화 관련 운동도 있었다고 하니 촛불이 가득 채웠던 광화문과 더욱 비슷한 느낌이 들었습니다.\n근데 프라하랑은 개인적으로 딱히 접점이 없어서일까요, 역사라던지가 머리에 잘 들어오지 않습니다. 암스테르담 같은 경우 민주화, 다양성 존중 등이 발전되어 있고 파이썬 창시자인 귀도 반 로썸 아저씨의 고향이라 그런지 꽤 하나하나가 와닿았는데 말이죠. 그래선지 어디가 어딘지도 잘 모르겠고 그냥 헤매듯이 정처없이 거닐었습니다. 그래도 어딜 가든 다 아름답고 멋집니다. 건축물들이 예술입니다. 근데 그래서 더 특색을 모르겠더군요. 저랑 프라하는 잘 안맞나봐요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/31.jpg)\n그렇게 걷다보니 만난 작은 공원. 공원을 원래 좋아하는터라 반가웠습니다. 공원의 반대편은 프라하 중앙역에 연결되어 있더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/32.jpg)\n컨퍼런스 회장으로 이동 중 만난. 뭔지 모를 곳. 낡은 건물이었는데 그 안은 천장이 뚫려있고 기차같은게 운행되고 있더군요. 뭔지 모르겠는데 멋졌습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/17.jpg)\n마침내 도착한 컨퍼런스 회장! 힐트 프라하입니다. 정식 일정은 내일부터지만 오늘도 미리 등록을 할 수 있습니다. 내일 와서 줄서긴 싫기도 하고, 미리 준비중인 회장을 구경하고 싶어서 왔습니다.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/33.jpg)\n등록 부스입니다. 아주 한산할 줄 알았는데 생각보다 사람이 있더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/15.jpg)\n등록 완료했습니다. 이 네임택 하나가, 그렇게 갖고 싶었습니다. 크흑.\n빨간 딱지는 선물 증정 부스에 제출해서 티셔츠 하나, 그리고 리셉션 때 맥주와 바꿀 수 있는 쿠폰을 받을 수 있게 되어 있더군요.\n![foo] (/img/osse_02/16.jpg)\n스폰서 기업들이 부스를 차리고 있는 분주한 모습도 볼 수 있었습니다. 내일은 이곳이 어떻게 꾸며질까 미리 어느정도 예상도 할 수 있었습니다.\n이제 어느덧 오후 4시가 되어갑니다만, 아침 9시부터 움직였으니 꽤 많은 일이 있었습니다. 일단 여기서 여행기의 두번째 포스트를 마무리 합니다.\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/osse2017_02/","summary":"Immigration ![immigration] (/img/osse_02/14.jpg)\n먼저 공항에서 입국심사를 거쳐야

입국심사 카드도 써야하고 여기 숙소 주소 등도 적어야 하고, 지문도 찍어야 하죠. 공항 보안검색대에선 투시카메라로 사진도 찍고.","title":"OSSummit 2017 Attendence - 02"},{"content":"![pargue!] (/img/osse_01/8.jpg)\nOpen Source Summit Europe 과 Embedded Linux Conference Europe, 그리고 Annual Kernel Summit 이 합동으로 열린 프라하에 다녀왔습니다. 이에 대한 기록을 남겨봅니다.\nThe Event 리눅스 재단에서는 다양한 컨퍼런스를 개최합니다. 2015년까지는 한국에서도 Korea Linux Forum 이라는 행사를 매년 열었죠. 특히 2015년에는 커널 서밋도 함께해서 특히 특별했던 기억입니다. 이런 이벤트들 중에서도 가장 큰 이벤트는 오픈소스 서밋이 아닐까 싶습니다. 이 이벤트는 기존의 리눅스콘 등 행사들이 합쳐진 행사입니다. 가장 큰 이벤트가 오픈소스 서밋이라면 가장 중요한 행사는 커널 서밋이라 할 수 있지 않을까 싶습니다. 커널 서밋은 커널 개발에 중요한 역할을 하는 메인테이너들이 모여 현재 개발 상의 이슈를 공유, 해결책을 토론하고 차후 개발을 위한 회의를 하는 자리입니다. 당연하지만 토발즈도 이 자리에 함께 합니다. 중요 개발자들끼리만 모이는 자리인 만큼 초대 형식으로만 참가할 수 있었는데, 2015년부터는 다른 이벤트와 함께 개최되어서 초반 몇일은 함께 열린 이벤트의 참가자들도 토의에 참여할 수 있게 되었습니다.\n올해는 프라하에서 오픈소스 서밋 유럽지역 행사와 임베디드 리눅스 컨퍼런스 유럽지역 행사, 그리고 커널 서밋이 함께 열렸습니다. 당연히 최신 정보를 얻고 다른 개발자들과 네트워킹을 할 수도 있고, 제 프로젝트인 GCMA 를 홍보할 수도 있는 기회이기에 꼭 참여해야겠다 싶었습니다.\nKOSSLAB 에서는 오픈소스 개발자들의 해외 컨퍼런스 참여를 지원합니다. 자원이 한정되어 있는 만큼 지원이 좀 까다롭습니다. 지원 신청은 발표자 또는 초대장을 받은 사람에 한정되며, 지원은 비행기표 비용이며, 발표자의 경우 호텔비 이틀치를 추가로 지원합니다. 즉, 컨퍼런스 등록비, 숙식을 위한 비용은 각자 부담해야 합니다. 지원한 모두를 지원하는 것도 아니고 내부 심사가 있습니다. 그래도 지원을 받는데 성공하면 매우 큰 도움이 되죠.\n저는 초대장을 받아 신청하게 되었는데, 지원 여부 결과가 꽤 늦게까지 발표되지 않았습니다. 초조하게 기다리고 있다가 어차피 각자 결제 후 차후 영수증을 통한 증빙을 통한 지원이라 전해듣고, 에라 모르겠다 하고 자비로 비행기표 등을 모두 구매했는데 다음날 아침, 지원을 해주기로 결정했다는 전화를 받았습니다. 다시 한번 KOSSLAB 에 감사한 마음을 전합니다 :D\nTo Incheon Airport ![Incheon Airport] (/img/osse_01/1.jpg)\n토요일 밤 인천 공항에서 출발해 이스탄불에서 한번 환승하고 프라하로 가는 터키항공 편을 구매했습니다. 빨래를 하고 짐을 싸며 낮시간을 보냈습니다. 인터넷 연결이 어려울 테니 볼만한 영화도 다운받고, 읽을거리도 인쇄해두고, 참여/관리중인 프로젝트들의 소스코드도 랩톱 안에 최신으로 땡겨둡니다. 해가 질 무렵, 공항으로 출발했습니다. 인천공항 가는길은 지하철을 사용합니다.\nTo Istanbul 알고보니 터키항공은 서비스가 좋기로 유명한 모양입니다. 상도 받았다는 것 같더군요.\n출발한 후에 승객들에게 파우치를 하나씩 주는데, 열어보면 안대와 슬리퍼, 귀마개, 칫솔, 립밤 등이 들어있습니다.\n![to_istanbul] (/img/osse_01/2.jpg)\n좌석에 제공되는 서비스도 좋은 편입니다. 의자에 USB 가 있어 핸드폰과 태블릿 등을 충전할 수 있고고, 좌석마다 달린 디스플레이를 통해 영화, 뉴스, 기내정보, 음악 등을 즐길 수 있습니다. 한글 자막이 제공되진 않지만 한국어 더빙 영화는 일부 있는 것 같습니다. 영어 자막은 대부분의 영화가 제공하므로 대충 누가 나쁜놈이고 착한놈인지 정도는 알아들을 수 있었습니다.\n요즘 비행기는 다들 이정도는 제공하는 것 같기도 하지만, 제 경우는 출장 때 외에는 비행기 타는 일이 거의 없고, 출장갈 때마다 가능한 저렴한 표를 구하는 편이다보니 (내가 힘들게 가는만큼 다른 친구들이 이득보겠거니 해서 그러는데, 굳이 그럴 필요는 없나 싶기도 하군요.) 좋은 비행기 타본 적이 없어서 디스플레이가 있는 비행기는 대략 3년만에 처음입니다. 감동의 눈물이 흘렀습니다.ㅜㅜ 근데 디스플레이 없는 비행기에 이미 너무 익숙해졌는지 영화를 잘 안보게 되는군요.\n![to_istanbul_first_food] (/img/osse_01/3.jpg)\n첫번째 기내식은 비빔밥과 파스타가 제공되었습니다. 한국에서 출발하는 만큼 비빔밥을 준비한 준비성은 좋지만 개인적으로 외국 여행중에는 외국 음식을 먹자는 편이고 고기류를 좋아하는 편이라 파스타를 먹으며 눈물을 흘렸습니다. 신기한건 와인을 주문하면 병째로 줍니다. 하지만 작은 병이라 컵 하나에 가득 따른 정도의 양과 비슷합니다. 한국계 항공사에서 주는것보단 많은 양이지만 델타 등의 미국계 항공사에서 주는 것과 비슷한 정도 같습니다.\n![to_istanbul_second_food] (/img/osse_01/4.jpg)\n내리기 전 제공되는 기내식은 오므라이스와 샌드위치입니다. 가볍게 먹기 좋았습니다.\n![istanbul_airport] (/img/osse_01/5.jpg)\n이스탄불 공항은 화려한 편이었습니다. 화장실은 좀 더러웠지만\u0026hellip; 특히 중간에 터키 아이스크림을 파는 가게가 있었는데, 고객을 놀려대며 즐거움을 주는 모습을 오프라인으로는처음 봤습니다. 신기하더군요. 아쉬운건 무료 와이파이가 없습니다. 정확히는, 있긴 한데 사용을 위해선 패스워드를 SMS 를 통해 받아야 합니다. 로밍을 켤 돈이 없어 그냥 버텼습니다. 환승 시간이 길지 않아 다행이었습니다.\n환승을 위해 게이트에 도착해 기다리는데 함께 기다리는 사람들 중 일부 한국 사람들이 게이트가 바뀌었다며 갑자기 뛰어갑니다. 확인해보니 정말로 바뀌어 있더군요. 이동하는 중에 이에 대한 내용이 뒤늦게 방송으로 나왔습니다. 외국인 분들은 뒤늦게 헐레벌떡 오시더군요. 저도 헐레벌떡이었지만.\n신기한게 게이트에서 여권 검사를 합니다. 덕분에 게이트에 들어가는데에도 줄이 생겼습니다. 머리가 길어 눈이 가려서 그런지 검사하는 분이 같은 사람 맞냐며 생일 등을 물어보는데 좀 긴장되더군요. 그래도 큰 문제 없이 통과. 비행기는 출발합니다.\nTo Prague ![to_prague] (/img/osse_01/6.jpg)\n환승 비행기도 터키항공. 이번 여행은 계속 터키항공만 이용합니다.\n![to_pargue_food]

for idle pages tracking. It can be used to get real working set size of a process.\nTools This section describes two tools in the box though more tools exists. You can get more description about each tool from the README in the repository[1].\nuserprog userprog is a sample synthetic workload for test of other tools. It interactively allocates and access specified pages in the allocated pages. After execution, it first asks how many pages to allocates. Once you type in how many pages to allocate, the program will repeatedly asks how many pages in the allocated pages you want to do access.\nwspages.sh Now you can calculate working set size of a process using the tools. To simplify the life even more, wspages.sh helps the complicated works. It requires pid, time interval, and target memory mapped regions as argument. The third argument can be ignored. In the case, it uses heap, stack, and anonymous pages as target memory region by default. If you give the arguments well, this tool will prints out number of pages accessed between the time interval. Simple example of usage and output is as below:\n$ sudo ./wspages.sh `pidof userprog` 1 [heap] 3 wspgstat.sh Like *stat programs (such as vmstat, iostat, \u0026hellip;), wspgstat.sh monitors and print out number of pages in working set of specific process repeatedly. It requires pid of target program, delay between idleness check, and target memory mapped regions as arguments. The third argument is optional and has default value as same as wspages.sh\u0026rsquo;s same argument. Simple example usage is as below:\n$ ./wspgstat.sh `pidof mysqld` 5 1 17448 9 21536 18 21659 Limitations The tools use idle page tracking feature of the Linux kernel[2] internally. It means that the tools work on Linux systems that idle page tracking feature is turned on.

DB 에서 이 파일 내에 적힌 sql 문들을 그대로 수행하라고 하면 8개의 테이블이 생성됩니다.\ndbgen 은 테이블에 데이터를 로드하는 sql 문을 생성합니다. dbgen 에 scale factor 등의 인자를 줘서 수행시키면 8개의 .tbl suffix 를 갖는 파일이 생성됩니다. 이 파일들은 각각 파일명에 일치하는 이름의 테이블에 데이터를 insert 하는 query 문들로 구성되어 있습니다. DB 에 이 파일 내의 sql 명령들을 수행하라고 하면 데이터가 로드되는 것입니다.\ndss.ri 는 테이블 인덱스 생성에 필요한 sql 문을 담고 있습니다. DB 에 이 파일 내의 sql 명령들을 수행하라고 함으로써 테이블 인덱스 생성이 완료되어 TPC-H 의 쿼리들을 수행할 준비가 마쳐집니다.\nQuery Creation and Execution qgen 은 TPC-H 의 분석 작업을 대표하는 22개의 쿼리를 생성해 줍니다. 22개의 쿼리라고 표현했지만 22 종류의 쿼리라고 하는게 옳을 겁니다. 동일한 쿼리의 경우 반복 수행되면 DB 에서 앞 쿼리의 결과를 캐시해 뒀다가 곧바로 리턴하기 때문에 인자 등은 달라야 하기 때문입니다. 이를 위해 dbgen/queries/ 디렉토리 아래에는 생성되어야 하는 22 종류 쿼리의 템플릿을 담고 있습니다. qgen 은 이 템플릿을 참고하고 랜덤하게 인자를 생성해 최종적으로 DB 에서 수행될 수 있는 쿼리문을 생성합니다. 이 때 랜덤 시드는 dists.dss 라는 파일을 참고해 만들어집니다.\nModify TPC-H Toolkit for MariaDB DBMS 마다 query syntax 가 조금씩 다릅니다. 때문에 TPC-H Toolkit 은 지원하는 DBMS 마다 다르게 테이블 생성, 쿼리 생성을 하도록 짜여져 있습니다만, 지원하는 DBMS 목록에 MariaDB 는 포함되어 있지 않습니다. 따라서 MariaDB 에 TPC-H 를 돌리기 위해선 TPC-H Toolkit 의 일부분을 수정해야 합니다.\n수정해야 하는 파일은 dss.ddl, dss.ri, 그리고 queries/ 디렉토리 아래의 템플릿 등입니다. 하나하나 설명하는 것은 너무 내용이 길어지므로, 수정 내용을 patch 형태로 만들어 github 에 올려두었습니다[5]. 이 패치 파일을 가져와서 다음과 같이 적용할 수 있습니다. 명령을 수행하는 디렉토리는 TPC-H Toolkit 소스코드 디렉토리 여야 합니다.\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjp38/tpch-mariadb/07fdcbfa9ba1be26f437ff130338a223d0dbfecd/0001-Modify-for-MariaDB.patch $ patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0001-Modify-for-MariaDB.patch 위 변경 사항은 makefile 의 수정도 포함되어 있습니다. 적용 후 dbgen, qgen 을 빌드해 줍시다.\nData Creation dbgen/ 디렉토리로 들어가 dbgen 을 수행해 줍니다. 인자로 scale factor 등을 줄 수 있습니다. -h 인자를 줘서 dbgen 의 수행 방법을 알 수 있으니 참고합시다. 수행이 마무리 되면 다음과 같이 8개의 .tbl suffix 를 갖는 파일들이 생성됩니다.\ndbgen$ ls -ahl *.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 187M Sep 9 10:48 customer.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 5.8G Sep 9 10:48 lineitem.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 2.2K Sep 9 10:48 nation.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 1.4G Sep 9 10:48 orders.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 919M Sep 9 10:48 partsupp.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 186M Sep 9 10:48 part.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 389 Sep 9 10:48 region.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 11M Sep 9 10:48 supplier.tbl 참고로, 위 수행결과는 scale factor 값을 8로 준 결과입니다.\nLoad Data 이제 MariaDB 를 사용해 tpch 라는 이름의 데이터베이스를 생성하고 (line 1) 그 아래 테이블을 생성하고 (line 2) 각 테이블에 데이터를 로드한 후 (line 3-5) 각 테이블의 인덱스까지 만들어 줍시다 (line 6).\n$ mysql -u root -p password -e \u0026#34;create database tpch;\u0026#34; $ mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; dss.ddl $ for table in customer lineitem nation orders partsupp part region supplier \\ do mysql -u root -p -e \\ \u0026#34;LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE \u0026#39;$table.tbl\u0026#39; FIELDS TERMINATED BY \u0026#39;|\u0026#39;;\u0026#34; done $ mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; ./dss.ri Create Queries 이제 쿼리를 만들어 봅시다. qgen 은 인자로 생성할 쿼리의 타입을 1-22 사이 숫자로 받아서 쿼리문을 생성, 화면에 뿌려줍니다. 다음과 같은 커맨드로 이를 따로 저장합니다. 아래 커맨드는 dbgen/ 디렉토리 아래에서 수행됨을 가정합니다.\n$ cd queries/ $ for i in {1..22}; do ../qgen $i \u0026gt; query-$i.sql; done 이제 dbgen/queries/ 디렉토리 아래에 query- 라는 prefix 의 쿼리문을 담는 파일 22개가 생성되어 있습니다.\nExecute Queries 앞서 생성한 쿼리문 파일은 MariaDB 에 호환되는 sql 문으로 구성되어 있으므로, 아래와 같이 간단히 실행시키면 됩니다.\n$ for i in {1..22}; do mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; dbgen/queries/query-$i.sql 일부 쿼리는 수십초, 일부 쿼리는 1초도 걸리지 않아 수행되는 걸 확인할 수 있습니다.\nConclusion TPC-H 가 어떻게 구성되어 있고 어떻게 수행시키며, MariaDB 에서의 수행을 위해서는 어떤 수정이 필요한지 설명했습니다. github 에 있는 자동화 스크립트[6]를 이용하면 이 과정을 손쉽게 한번에 해결할 수 있습니다.\nReferences [1] http://datawarehouse4u.info/OLTP-vs-OLAP.html\n[2] http://www.tpc.org/tpch/\n[3] http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/pdf/tpc-h_v2.17.2.pdf\n[4] http://www.tpc.org/tpc_documents_current_versions/download_programs/tools-download-request.asp?bm_type=TPC-H\u0026amp;bm_vers=2.17.2\u0026amp;mode=CURRENT-ONLY\n[5] https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjp38/tpch-mariadb/07fdcbfa9ba1be26f437ff130338a223d0dbfecd/0001-Modify-for-MariaDB.patch\n[6] https://github.com/sjp38/tpch-mariadb\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/tpch-on-mariadb/","summary":"Database 를 위해 사용되는 벤치마크는 크게 OLTP vs OLAP 로 나뉩니다[1].

Refer to it if you need strict specification of the benchmark. Nonetheless, I give you a rough description of the benchmark here, though. TPC-H stores a huge data into 8 tables and run 22 queries analysing this data. To measure the performance, we can measure the time to store/load the data, runtime of each of the 22 queries, and the throughput (number of processed queries per second) of multiple sessions.\nGet TPC-H Toolkit TPC provides the specification says how the tables should be constructed, what data should be stored in the tables, and what kind of queries should be issued. So, anyone can implement their TPC-H based on this specification. Nonetheless, as manual read of the specification and manual implementation can be boring and exhaustive to someone. For the reason, TPC officially provides a tool, namely TPC-H Toolkit, that helps creation of the tables, the data, and the queries. If you go to the site[4], enter your personal information, and agree to the license, they will send you a link to download the TPC-H Toolkit by mail.\nThe file is in zip format.

Before that, let\u0026rsquo;s see how we run TPC-H using the files under dbgen/ directory.\nData Preparation dss.ddl file has the sql statements be used for the creation of the 8 tables. If you command your DB to execute the sql statements in this file, the 8 tables will be created.\ndbgen creates the sql statements that stores the data to the table. If you run the dbgen with optional arguments including scale factor, 8 files having .tbl suffix will be created. Each of these files has query statements inserting the data to the table having same name with the file. You can store the data to the tables by making your DB to run the sql statements.\ndss.ri has a sql statement creating the table index. Once your DB runs these sql statements, the table index will be generated and you will be ready to run the TPC-H queries.\nQuery Creation and Execution qgen creates the queries doing the TPC-H\u0026rsquo;s analysis tasks. We simply said 22 queries, but it would be better to say 22 kinds of queries. If a query is repeatedly issued with same arguments, DB server can cache the results and simply return it to the client. As this can distort the results, TPC-H Toolkit has the template of the 22 queries under dbgen/queries/ directory and let qgen to create query statements using random arguments, based on this templates. The seed for the random number generation is created based on dists.dss file.\nModify TPC-H Toolkit for MariaDB Each DBMS has a little bit different query syntax. Thus, TPC-H Toolkit is made to support multiple DBMSes, but the MariaDB is not in the supported DBMSes. Therefore, you should modify a part of the TPC-H Toolkit to run TPC-H on the MariaDB.\nThe files need modifications are dss.ddl, dss.ri, and the templates under the queries/ directory. As the description of the each of the modifications will be too long, I simply made patches for the modifications and uploaded on Github[5]. You can apply the patch files to your TPC-H Toolkit as below. You should be on the TPC-H Toolkit source code directory while running below command.\n$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sjp38/tpch-mariadb/07fdcbfa9ba1be26f437ff130338a223d0dbfecd/0001-Modify-for-MariaDB.patch $ patch -p1 \u0026lt; 0001-Modify-for-MariaDB.patch The changes above includes the modification of the makefile. After applying, build dbgen and qgen.\nData Creation Now, move to dbgen/ directory and run dbgen. You can give scale factor using its argument. Refer to the usage of dbgen using -h option. After its execution, you can see below 8 .tbl files.\ndbgen$ ls -ahl *.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 187M Sep 9 10:48 customer.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 5.8G Sep 9 10:48 lineitem.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 2.2K Sep 9 10:48 nation.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 1.4G Sep 9 10:48 orders.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 919M Sep 9 10:48 partsupp.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 186M Sep 9 10:48 part.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 389 Sep 9 10:48 region.tbl -rw-rw-r-- 1 sjpark sjpark 11M Sep 9 10:48 supplier.tbl The above results used scale factor value as 8.\nLoad Data Now, with your MariaDB, create a database named tpch (line 1), create tables under the database (line 2), load the data to the tables (lines 3-5), and make index for each of the tables (line 6).\n$ mysql -u root -p password -e \u0026#34;create database tpch;\u0026#34; $ mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; dss.ddl $ for table in customer lineitem nation orders partsupp part region supplier \\ do mysql -u root -p -e \\ \u0026#34;LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE \u0026#39;$table.tbl\u0026#39; FIELDS TERMINATED BY \u0026#39;|\u0026#39;;\u0026#34; done $ mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; ./dss.ri Create Queries Now, create the queries. qgen receives a number from 1 to 22 which means the type of the queries to create, generate the query statement, and print on the screen. You can save the queries with below commands. This example assumes it is executed on the dbgen/ directory.\n$ cd queries/ $ for i in {1..22}; do ../qgen $i \u0026gt; query-$i.sql; done Now, you have 22 query- prefixed files containing each type of queries under the dbgen/queries/ directory.\nExecute Queries As the query files have sql statement compatible with MariaDB, you can simply run them as below.\n$ for i in {1..22}; do mysql -u root -p password \u0026lt; dbgen/queries/query-$i.sql Few queries will take few of tens of seconds to complete while another queries take less than 1 second.\nConclusion This post summarised how TPC-H is constructed, how you can run it, and what modifications are required to run it on MariaDB.

This post describes how you can run TPC-H against MariaDB.\nEnvironment Setup The versions of the OS and programs I used for writeup of this post are as below.\nUbuntu 16.04.2 Server MariaDB 10.2.8 TPC-H toolkit 2.17.2 Automated Scripts I automated whole things I will describe below using scripts and uploaded the scripts to the Github: https://github.","title":"TPC-H on MariaDB (MySQL)"},{"content":"악의 조직 Oracle 에서 Sun 을 인수한 후 이어진 반 open source 적 행보에 MySQL 개발자는 MySQL 을 fork 해서 MariaDB 를 개발하고 있습니다. 저작권을 악용해 중요한 기능은 천천히 릴리즈 하거나 유료 라이센스로만 공개하기도 하는 Oracle 의 MySQL 과 달리 MariaDB 는 예전 MySQL 처럼 공개적으로 개발되고 있어 새롭고 진보적인 기능도 많이 있는 편인 것 같습니다.\n이 글에서는 Ubuntu 16.04 서버에 MariaDB 를 소스코드부터 가져와서 설치하고 사용하는 간단한 사용법을 정리해 봅니다.\nEnvironment 이 글에서는 Ubuntu 16.04.2 server 버전을 사용합니다.\nBuild and Install MariaDB 는 대부분의 리눅스 배포본을 위한 패키징이 잘 되어 있어서 각 배포본의 패키징 시스템을 사용하면 한두줄의 커맨드로 쉽게 설치할 수 있습니다. 하지만 여기선 문서[1] 를 참고해 가며 소스 코드부터 가져와서 바닥부터 가장 최신 버전을 설치해 보기로 합시다.\n소스코드는 github 에 git repository 의 형태로 공개되어 있습니다. 아래의 명령어로 코드를 mariadb/ 디렉토리 아래에 가져올 수 있습니다.\n$ git clone https://github.com/MariaDB/server.git mariadb $ cd mariadb git repository 인만큼 버전은 git 을 통해 tag 로 관리되고 있습니다. 이 글을 작성 중인 시점에서 가장 최신 stable 릴리즈는 10.2.8[2] 로, 2017년 8월 18일 자로 릴리즈 되었습니다. 다음 커맨드로 해당 버전의 코드를 checkout 할 수 있습니다:\n$ git checkout mariadb-10.2.8 이제 소스코드는 준비되었고, 빌드할 차례입니다. cmake 를 사용해 어떻게 빌드할지 등을 설정할 수 있는데, 여기선 release 할때 사용하는 설정을 사용해 보겠습니다. cmake 가 실패하는 경우는 대부분 필요 패키지가 설치되지 않은 경우입니다. libaio-dev, libjemalloc-dev, libgnutls-dev 등의 패키지가 설치되어 있어야 합니다.\n해당 패키지 설치 후에도 같은 에러 메세지가 나올 수 있는데, cmake 의 기존 결과가 캐싱되어 재사용되기 때문입니다. CMakeCache.txt 와 CMakeFiles/ 디렉토리를 제거해주면 캐싱된 내용은 사라집니다.\n이어서 간단히 make 를 사용해 빌드하고 설치를 할 수 있습니다. 설치는 super user 권한이 필요하기 때문에 sudo 를 사용해야 합니다.\n$ cmake . -DBUILD_CONFIG=mysql_release $ make $ sudo make install 어떤 사양의 머신에서 빌드하느냐에 따라 다르겠지만 빌드하는데 꽤 긴 시간이 걸립니다. 이 글을 작성하며 사용한 72 코어 / 144 쓰레드 머신에서는 -j144 옵션을 줘서 빌드할 경우 1분 5초 걸렸습니다. 별다른 에러 메세지가 없다면 빌드에 성공한 것입니다.\nInitialize MariaDB Server 이제 MariaDB 의 기본 설치는 마무리 되었지만, 아직 MariaDB 구동을 위한 준비가 모두 끝나진 않았습니다. MariaDB 가 제대로 동작하기 위해서는 test database, default user 등등의 최소 데이터를 생성하는 초기화 작업을 진행해야 합니다. 앞의 설치는 MariaDB 실행파일을 만들어 시스템에 설치한 것이고, 이 초기화 작업은 MariaDB 서비스의 설치라고 생각하면 이해가 조금 편할 수도 있겠습니다.\nsuper user 권한의 남용은 보안적으로 위험할 수 있으므로, MariaDB 는 기본적으로 별개의 사용자 계정을 사용할 것을 권장합니다. 다음 예에서는 mysql 이라는 이름의 user 를 생성하고 이 사용자 계정을 사용하도록 해서 초기화를 진행합니다.\n$ sudo adduser mysql $ sudo chown -R mysql /usr/local/mysql/ $ cd /usr/local/mysql/ $ sudo -u mysql ./scripts/mysql_install_db --user=mysql 순조롭게 진행되었다면 다음과 같은 메세지를 볼 수 있을 겁니다:\nInstalling MariaDB/MySQL system tables in \u0026#39;./data\u0026#39; ... OK To start mysqld at boot time you have to copy support-files/mysql.server to the right place for your system PLEASE REMEMBER TO SET A PASSWORD FOR THE MariaDB root USER ! To do so, start the server, then issue the following commands: \u0026#39;./bin/mysqladmin\u0026#39; -u root password \u0026#39;new-password\u0026#39; \u0026#39;./bin/mysqladmin\u0026#39; -u root -h hydra password \u0026#39;new-password\u0026#39; Alternatively you can run: \u0026#39;./bin/mysql_secure_installation\u0026#39; which will also give you the option of removing the test databases and anonymous user created by default. This is strongly recommended for production servers. See the MariaDB Knowledgebase at http://mariadb.com/kb or the MySQL manual for more instructions. You can start the MariaDB daemon with: cd \u0026#39;.\u0026#39; ; ./bin/mysqld_safe --datadir=\u0026#39;./data\u0026#39; You can test the MariaDB daemon with mysql-test-run.pl cd \u0026#39;./mysql-test\u0026#39; ; perl mysql-test-run.pl Please report any problems at http://mariadb.org/jira The latest information about MariaDB is available at http://mariadb.org/.

Test 는 정확성 테스트만을 위한, 빨리 끝나는 데이터로 이 인자를 주지 않으면 default 로 이 값이 취해집니다. native 는 가장 realworld workload 에 가까운 벤치마크를 위한 데이터라 볼 수 있습니다.\n-p 옵션을 통해 어떤 sub benchmark 를 돌릴지 정할 수 있습니다. 이 옵션을 별도로 주지 않으면 모든 benchmark 를 돌리게 됩니다.\n-n 옵션은 number of threads to use 입니다.\n예를 들어 parsecmgmt -p canneal -a run -i native -n 1 은 canneal sub benchmark 하나만을 쓰레드 한개 써서 native 데이터셋으로 실행합니다.\nReferences [1] http://parsec.cs.princeton.edu\n[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_Old_Documentation\n[3] https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/snipersim/_1qpbmpPRtg\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/parsec_3_howto/","summary":"PARSEC 은 멀티쓰레드 프로그램들로 구성된 benchmark suite 입니다. 멀티쓰레드로 구성되어 있기 때문에 멀티코어 시스템에서의 multi core scalability 를 테스트 하기에도 적합합니다. 이 글에선 현재 최신 버전인 3.0 버전의 PARSEC 을 Ubuntu 16.04 server 에 설치하면서 겪는 문제의 해결법과 간단한 사용법을 정리해 봅니다.\nToolbox for PARSEC 3.0 on Ubuntu Xenial 아래의 내용을 하나하나 읽어가면서 따라하는 것도 귀찮은 일입니다. 그래서 아래에서 설명하는, Ubuntu Xenial 에서 PARSEC 3.0 을 돌리기 위해 필요한 작업을 대부분 자동으로 해주는 도구들을 만들어 두었습니다.","title":"Parsec 3.0 설치 / 사용법"},{"content":"여러개의 리눅스 데스크탑 PC 를 한 책상 위에서 사용하는 경우가 있다. 이 때, 한 PC 에서 Ctrl-C 해서 clipboard 에 복사한 내용을 다른쪽 PC 에서 Ctrl-V 로 붙여넣고 싶은 경우가 있다. 여러가지 해결책이 있겠으나, 다음과 같이 ssh 와 xclip 을 사용해서 해결할 수도 있다:\n$ ssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;remote host\u0026gt; \u0026#39;DISPLAY=:0 xclip -o -selection clipboard\u0026#39; | \\ xclip -i -selection clipboard 참고: http://askubuntu.com/questions/513442/can-two-pcs-with-ubuntu-share-the-clipboard-buffer\n","permalink":"https://sjp38.github.io/posts/ko/xclip_copy_remote_clipboard/","summary":"여러개의 리눅스 데스크탑 PC 를 한 책상 위에서 사용하는 경우가 있다. 이 때, 한 PC 에서 Ctrl-C 해서 clipboard 에 복사한 내용을 다른쪽 PC 에서 Ctrl-V 로 붙여넣고 싶은 경우가 있다. 여러가지 해결책이 있겠으나, 다음과 같이 ssh 와 xclip 을 사용해서 해결할 수도 있다:\n$ ssh \u0026lt;username\u0026gt;@\u0026lt;remote host\u0026gt; \u0026#39;DISPLAY=:0 xclip -o -selection clipboard\u0026#39; | \\ xclip -i -selection clipboard 참고: http://askubuntu.com/questions/513442/can-two-pcs-with-ubuntu-share-the-clipboard-buffer","title":"원격 데스크탑의 clipboard 를 ssh 와 xclip 으로 복사해오기"},{"content":"SPEC, which is a standard corporation for the benchmark[1], makes and shares various benchmark suites. SPEC CPU 2006[1] is one of those benchmark suites. It has made to measure performance of computation intensive workload and widely being used now. It has released v1.0 in 2006, 1.1 in 2008, and 1.2 in 2011. This post briefly describes the way to install and execute the SPEC CPU 2006 v1.1 on Ubuntu 16.04 servers.\nAutomated Toolbox For those who might say TL; DR, I wrote a script that can install and execute the SPEC CPU 2006 with one command[1]. If you have no time to read further, just use it, please.\n[1] https://github.com/sjp38/spec_on_ubuntu_xenial\nTest Environment The test machine I used for this post has:\nIntel Xeon E7-8870 v3 Linux 4.10 kernel Ubuntu 16.04.1 Server version Get The Source Code You should get the source code first. You can buy SPEC CPU 2006 in DVD or .iso file format (As of March 2017, the cost of the SPEC CPU 2006 v1.2 is $800). There are source code of the benchmarks, source code of tool programs that helps compile, execution, and verification of the benchmarks, pre-compiled tool programs, rule files for the execution of the benchmarks, and documents. This post is written basedon SPEC CPU 2006 v1.1. If you got the .iso file, you can access to the files in it by mounting it as below:\n$ mkdir tmnt $ sudo mount -o loop SPEC_CPU2006v1.1.iso ./tmnt $ ls tmnt It is ok to directly install and execute the benchmarks, but I prefer to first copy the files outside of the mounted dir. The owner of the files is root, as the above command mounted the file via the sudo command. Change the owner to you as below:\n$ mkdir SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ cp -R ./tmnt/* SPEC_CPU2006v1.1/ $ sudo umount ./tmnt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -fr ./tmnt $ sudo chown -R \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ sudo chmod -R 755 SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ cd SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 Build The Tools The .iso file has executable binaries for the tools, which is built for various platforms such as redhat and suse. But, there is no binary for Ubuntu. Therefore, you should build the tools from the source code as below:\n$ cd tools/src $ ./buildtools buildtools is a shell script which builds tools under tools/src.

This program is located under bin/ dir of the SPEC CPU source code, but you can use it directly without entering path, as the above envrionment variables setting has registered it as $PATH. For example, if you want to execute mcf benchmark, you can use below command:\n$ runspec --iterations 1 --size ref --action onlyrun --config config.cfg --noreportable mcf This command executes mcf benchmark and prints the path to the log file describing the execution results.\n...

SPEC CPU 2006 은 DVD 또는 .iso 파일의 형태로 구매 [2] 될 수 있습니다 (작성 시점에서 SPEC CPU 2006 v1.2 의 가격은 $800 군요). 이렇게 구매된 DVD 안에는 벤치마크 소스코드와 벤치마크의 컴파일과 수행, 검증을 위한 tool 프로그램들의 소스코드, 미리 컴파일된 tool 프로그램들, 벤치마크 실행을 위한 규칙 파일, 그리고 문서등이 들어있습니다. 이 글에선 SPEC CPU 2006 v1.1 을 바탕으로 설명합니다. .iso 파일을 구했다면 다음과 같은 명령으로 mount 해서 그 안의 파일들을 보고 사용할 수 있습니다:\n$ mkdir tmnt $ sudo mount -o loop SPEC_CPU2006v1.1.iso ./tmnt $ ls tmnt 마운트한 위치에서 곧바로 설치 / 실행을 수행해도 좋지만 파일을 복사해두고 사용하겠습니다. mount 를 sudo 로 해야하는 관계로 이 파일들의 owner 는 root 이며 쓰기권한도 없습니다. 굳이 root 가 되지 않고도 벤치마크를 설치하고 돌릴 수 있으므로 파일의 owner 와 권한을 바꿔줍니다:\n$ mkdir SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ cp -R ./tmnt/* SPEC_CPU2006v1.1/ $ sudo umount ./tmnt \u0026amp;\u0026amp; rm -fr ./tmnt $ sudo chown -R \u0026lt;username\u0026gt; SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ sudo chmod -R 755 SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 $ cd SPEC_CPU2006v1.1 툴 빌드 SPEC 에서 사용되는 도구들은 앞서 가져온 .iso 파일 안에 redhat, suse 등 여러 플랫폼 용으로 미리 빌드되어 있습니다. 하지만 Ubuntu 를 위한 버전은 없습니다. 따라서 다음과 같이 소스코드로부터 직접 빌드를 해야 합니다:\n$ cd tools/src $ ./buildtools buildtools 는 셸 스크립트로, tools/src 아래 있는 각 툴들을 빌드합니다. 곧바로 진행되면 좋겠지만, 다음과 같은 에러들이 발생합니다.\nConflicting types for \u0026lsquo;getline\u0026rsquo; md5sum 빌드 중 다음과 같은 에러 메세지가 나옵니다:\ngcc -DHAVE_CONFIG_H -I/home/sjpark/SPEC_CPU2006v1.1/tools/output/include -I. -Ilib -c -o md5sum.o md5sum.c In file included from md5sum.c:38:0: lib/getline.h:31:1: error: conflicting types for \u0026#39;getline\u0026#39; getline PARAMS ((char **_lineptr, size_t *_n, FILE *_stream)); ^ md5sum 빌드 중 getline(), getdelim() 함수가 stdio.h 에서 선언되어 있는데도 getline.h 파일에 또 선언되어서 conflicting type 으로 나는 문제입니다. 역시 툴 중 하나인 tar 의 경우엔 GLIBC 버전을 체크해 2 이상일 경우엔 해당 declaration 을 제거해 두었는데, md5sum 아래의 getline.h 엔 이 체크가 없기 때문에 문제가 됩니다. 다음과 같이 GLIBC 버전 체크를 추가해 중복선언이 없도록 수정해 줍니다:\n--- a/tools/src/specmd5sum/lib/getline.h +++ b/tools/src/specmd5sum/lib/getline.h @@ -27,10 +27,14 @@ Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA. */ # endif # endif +# if __GLIBC__ \u0026lt; 2 + int getline PARAMS ((char **_lineptr, size_t *_n, FILE *_stream)); int getdelim PARAMS ((char **_lineptr, size_t *_n, int _delimiter, FILE *_stream)); +#endif + #endif /* not GETLINE_H_ */ Undefined reference to pow 이 문제와 아래의 두개의 문제는 인터넷 상의 SPEC CPU 2000 에 대한 비슷한 문제의 해결책[3] 을 참고했습니다.\n이제 perl 빌드 중 다음과 같은 에러 메세지가 발생합니다:\ncc -L/home/sjpark/SPEC_CPU2006v1.1/tools/output/lib -L/usr/local/lib -o miniperl \\ miniperlmain.o opmini.o libperl.a libperl.a(pp.o): In function `Perl_pp_pow\u0026#39;: pp.c:(.text+0x2a76): undefined reference to `pow\u0026#39; pow 함수를 찾지 못하는 문제로, libm 라이브러리를 링크 시점에 링크하도록 알려줘야 합니다. 다음과 같이 PERLFLAGS 환경변수를 설정하고 buildtools 를 실행하는 것으로 해결할 수 있습니다:\n$ PERLFLAGS=\u0026quot;-A libs=-lm -A libs=-ldl\u0026quot; ./buildtools\nYou haven\u0026rsquo;t done a \u0026ldquo;make depend\u0026rdquo; yet!
